  abstract	= {Lazy allocation is a model for allocating objects on the
		  execution stack of a high-level language which does not
		  create dangling references. Our model provides safe
		  transportation into the heap for objects that may survive the
		  deallocation of the surrounding stack frame. Space for
		  objects that do not survive the deallocation of the
		  surrounding stack frame is reclaimed without additional
		  effort when the stack is popped. Lazy allocation thus
		  performs a first-level garbage collection, and if the
		  language supports garbage collection of the heap, then our
		  model can reduce the amortized cost of allocation in such a
		  heap by filtering out the short-lived objects that can be
		  more efficiently managed in LIFO order. A run-time mechanism
		  called result expectation further filters out unneeded
		  results from functions called only for their effects. In a
		  shared-memory multi-processor environment, this filtering
		  reduces contention for the allocation and management of
		  global memory.Our model performs simple local operations, and
		  is therefore suitable for an interpreter or a hardware
		  implementation. Its overheads for functional data are
		  associated only with assignments, making lazy allocation
		  attractive for mostly functional programming styles. Many
		  existing stack allocation optimizations can be seen as
		  instances of this generic model, in which some portion of
		  these local operations have been optimized away through
		  static analysis techniques.Important applications of our
		  model include the efficient allocation of temporary data
		  structures that are passed as arguments to anonymous
		  procedures which may or may not use these data structures in
		  a stack-like fashion. The most important of these objects are
		  functional arguments (funargs), which require some run-time
		  allocation to preserve the local environment. Since a funarg
		  is sometimes returned as a first-class value, its lifetime
		  can survive the stack frame in which it was
		  created. Arguments which are evaluated in a lazy fashion
		  (Scheme delays or "suspensions") are similarly
		  handled. Variable-length argument "lists" themselves can be
		  allocated in this fashion, allowing these objects to become
		  "first-class". Finally, lazy allocation correctly handles the
		  allocation of a Scheme control stack, allowing Scheme
		  continuations to become first-class values.},

    Each name server is an independent authority that allows clients to
    describe users and organizations with a multiplicity of attributes; the
    name space abstraction is a client program that implements a discipline for
    searching a sequence of name servers; and the interface provides a tool

		  prepare and interconnect mixed-language software components
		  for execution in heterogeneous environments. POLYLITH's
		  principal benefit is that programmers are free to implement
		  functional requirements separately from their treatment of
		  interfacing requirements; this means that once an application
		  has been developed for use in one execution environment (such
		  as a distributed network) it can be adapted for reuse in
		  other environments (such as a shared-memory multiprocessor)
		  by automatic techniques. This flexibility is provided without
		  loss of performance. We accomplish this by creating a new
		  run-time organization for software. An abstract decoupling
		  agent, called the software bus, is introduced between the
		  system components. Heterogeneity in language and architecture
		  is accommodated since program units are prepared to interface
		  directly to the bus and not to other program
		  units. Programmers specify application structure in terms of
		  a module interconnection language (MIL); POLYLITH uses this
		  specification to guide packaging (static interfacing
		  activities such as stub generation, source program
		  adaptation, compilation, and linking). At run time, an
		  implementation of the bus abstraction may assist in message
		  delivery, name service, or system reconfiguration.",

		  studied in the context of several different applications in
		  the construction, optimization, maintenance, testing, and
		  debugging of programs. Algorithms are available for
		  constructing slices for a particular execution of a program
		  (dynamic slices), as well as to approximate a subset of the
		  behavior over all possible executions of a program (static
		  slices). However, these algorithms have been studied only in
		  the context of small abstract languages. Program slicing is
		  bound to remain an academic exercise unless one can not only
		  demonstrate the feasibility of building a slicer for
		  nontrivial programs written in a real programming language,
		  but also verify that a type of slice is sufficiently thin, on
		  the average, for the application for which it is chosen. In
		  this article, we present results from using SLICE, a dynamic
		  program slicer for C programs, designed and implemented to
		  experiment with several different kinds of program slices and
		  to study them both qualitatively and quantitatively. Several
		  application programs, ranging in size (i.e., number of lines
		  of code) over two orders of magnitude, were sliced
		  exhaustively to obtain average worst-case metrics for the
		  size of program slices.",

		  uniform addressing mechanism, and parallel composition. Both
		  languages have been used extensively for large-scale
		  application development, allowing us to provide an informed
		  assessment of both their strengths and their weaknesses. We
		  observe that while compositionality simplifies development of
		  complex applications, the use of specialized languages
		  hinders reuse of existing code and tools and the
		  specification of domain decomposition strategies. This
		  suggests an alternative approach based on small extensions to
		  existing sequential languages. We conclude the article with a

  abstract     = "Partial-evaluation folklore has it that massaging one's
		  source programs can make them specialize better. In Jones,
		  Gomard, and Sestoft's recent textbook, a whole chapter is
		  dedicated to listing such ``binding-time improvements'':
		  non-standard use of continuation-passing style,
		  eta-expansion, and a popular transformation called The
		  Trick. We provide a unified view of these binding-time
		  improvements, from a typing perspective.
		  
		  Just as a proper treatment of product values in partial
		  evaluation requires partially static values, a proper
		  treatment of disjoint sums requires moving static contexts
		  across dynamic case expressions. This requirement precisely
		  accounts for the non-standard use of continuation-passing
		  style encountered in partial evaluation. Eta-expansion thus
		  acts as a uniform binding-time coercion between values and
		  contexts, be they of function type, product type, or
		  disjoint-sum type. For the latter case, it enables The
		  Trick.
		  
		  In this paper, we extend Gomard and Jones's partial evaluator
		  for the lambda-calculus, lambda-Mix, with products and
		  disjoint sums; we point out how eta-expansion for (finite)
		  disjoint sums enables The Trick; we generalize our earlier

    transfers (thereby eliminating copies) and send messages (thereby reducing
    send-response latency).  In addition, the ASH system provides support for

    traversals) and dynamic protocol composition (thereby supporting
    modularity).  ASHs provide this high degree of flexibility while still
    providing network performance as good as, or (if they exploit
    application-specific knowledge) even better than, hard-wired in-kernel

    product to some predefined set of functional requirements at a specified
    level of quality.  The software is considered valid when it conforms to
    these “quality factors” at some acceptable level.  There are a large number
    of quality factors against which software may be validated.  This paper
    discusses the development of traditional software metrics in relation to
    the anticipated structure of a software system.  The taxonomy of a software
    system primarily relies upon the dissection of the software system into
    modules.  Modular design is the cornerstone of quality software, and
    metrics that can predict an optimum modular structure are critical.  By
    examining the theoretical bases on quality metrics, a base set of common
    quantitative metrics can be devised and mapped to quality metrics in which
    they reside.  This paper surveys existing metrics and suggests the
    derivation of software design metrics from software quality factors.
    Measurable software attributes are identified and suggested as potential
    design metrics."

    stands for the file system's ability to integrate different media types
    (RAM, harddisks, WORM optical disks, CDROMs, tape devices, RAIDs etc.) into
    a virtual storage, and making applications unaware of this aggregation.  A
    prototype C++ implementation of the proposed design, called the VANILLA
    file system, is presented and its performance assessed.  Raw-write
    performance is up to 4.5 times higher than in a standard Sun OS file
    system.  We will also demonstrate how various storage organization forms,
    especially hierarchies, arrays, and mirrors of both local and remote
    storages, can be realized using the proposed file system class library.",

    layers laid over native operating systems to provide a distributed

    procedure library).  In both levels of interaction with users, the set of
    machines integrated by HetNOS are seen as a distributed virtual machine.The
    HetNOS command interpreter, namely hsh, implements most functions present
    in more traditional command interpreters.  It is possible to spawn,
    monitor, and terminate processes in any host in the network like in the
    local case.  The HetNOS distributed kernel uses a symbolic, global,
    location independent, process identification scheme.  Distributed
    applications are split into sequential processes, which interact with each
    other by message exchange.  There are neither connections nor ports, being
    the communication mechanism strongly influenced by the process
    identification scheme.  This paper briefly describes the HetNOS software
    organization, presents the HetNOS environment for distributed programming,
    and then compares HetNOS with related work.",

    of uniform description of different rollback recovery control algorithms
    for distributed systems.  We first developed a general definition of the
    distributed rollback recovery control problem.  The concept of a
    distributed recovery control system (DRC system), consisting of distributed
    recovery control units (DRC units), is proposed to model recovery with
    various control granularities.  Then, we developed a graph model, called
    dependency graph, for distributed rollback recovery control algorithms.  An
    atomic subgraph is defined as a subgraph induced by a set of nodes which
    has no outgoing arcs to other nodes in the graph.  Committing and aborting
    atomic actions can be modeled as identifying atomic subgraphs.  Next, we
    defined two kinds of dependency graphs: checkpoint graphs and unit graphs,
    based on the dependency relation defined by rollback propagation.  We have
    shown that various types of distributed recovery control algorithms can be
    classified based on the identifications of atomic subgraphs in these two
    graphs.  Therefore, using the model may allow us to describe existing
    algorithms in a uniform way and, more importantly, to find new
    algorithms.",

  abstract     = "Interactions between distributed applications presuppose an
		  underlying control model to coordinate information exchanges
		  and networking software to implement that model.  The
		  client/server control model defines distributed interactions
		  in terms of one program requesting and obtaining a service
		  from a second, possibly remote, application.  However, this
		  basic model provides inadequate design support when clients
		  need to invoke multiple, independent services, coordinated to
		  reflect how those services interrelate and contribute to the
		  overall application.  The author describes extensions to the
		  basic client/ server model that explicitly address
		  one-to-many client/ server interactions by discussing three
		  basic design issues: how multiple services are requested, how
		  those services are managed, and how clients receive
		  responses.  The extended coordination models provide support
		  for locating, obtaining, and synchronizing services, as well
		  as for collecting and combining results from multiple servers
		  in a manner that is transparent to clients.  Extended models
		  include a scripting engine for managing data and temporal
		  dependencies among services; a basic request broker for
		  mediating client access to distributed services; and extended
		  request broker models that decompose composite services,
		  manage redundant servers, and replicate messages to logical
		  server groups.  These coordination models were designed as
		  generic, programmable control services. The control services
		  are interoperable, so they can be combined like building
		  blocks to match application-specific coordination
		  requirements.  The one-to-many coordination services are
		  layered on top of an object-oriented, message-passing
		  communication substrate, which transparently manages the
		  complexities of interprogram interactions across networks of
		  heterogeneous computers.  This layered architecture lets
		  complex coordination behaviors be modeled and executed
		  external to application elements.  It accomplishes this
		  through high-level application programming interface (API)
		  calls.  The resulting partitioning of application and generic
		  distributed behaviors yields improved modularity,
		  maintainability, and extensibility of individual clients and
		  servers.",

		  (SSA) form. The new algorithm is based on computing the Merge
		  set of each node in the control flow graph of a function (a
		  node here represents a basic block and the terms will be used
		  interchangeably). Merge set of a node n is the set of nodes
		  N, where -functions may need to be placed if variables are
		  defined in n. It is not necessary for n to have a definition
		  of a variable in it. Thus, the merge set of n is dictated by
		  the underlying structure of the CFG. The new method presented
		  here precomputes the merge set of every node in the CFG using
		  an iterative approach. Later, these merge sets are used to
		  carry out the actual -function placement. The advantages are
		  in examples where dense definitions of variables are present
		  (i.e., original definitions of variables---user defined or
		  otherwise, in a majority of basic blocks). Our experience
		  with SSA in the High Level Optimizer (optimization levels
		  +O3/+O4) shows that most examples from the Spec2000
		  benchmark suite require a high percentage of basic blocks to
		  have their  points computed. Previous methods of computing
		  the same relied on the dominance frontier (DF) concept, first
		  introduced by Cytron et al. The method presented in this
		  paper gives a new effective iterative solution to the
		  problem. Also, in cases, where the control flow graph does
		  not change, our method does not require any additional
		  computation for new definitions introduced as part of
		  optimizations. We present implementation details with results
		  from Spec2000 benchmarks. Our algorithm runs faster than the

		  machines, are widely deployed platforms for executing

		  features that operating systems provide: interapplication
		  memory protection and basic system services. They do not,
		  however, provide the ability to isolate applications from
		  each other. Neither do they provide the ability to limit the
		  resource consumption of applications. Consequently, the
		  performance of current systems degrades severely in the
		  presence of malicious or buggy code that exhibits ill-behaved
		  resource usage. We show that Java runtime systems can be
		  extended to support processes, and that processes can provide
		  robust and efficient support for untrusted applications.We
		  have designed and built KaffeOS, a Java runtime system that
		  provides support for processes. KaffeOS isolates processes
		  and manages the physical resources available to them: CPU and
		  memory. Unlike existing Java virtual machines, KaffeOS can
		  safely terminate processes without adversely affecting the
		  integrity of the system, and it can fully reclaim a
		  terminated process's resources. Finally, KaffeOS requires no
		  changes to the Java language. The novel aspects of the
		  KaffeOS architecture include the application of a user/kernel
		  boundary as a structuring principle for runtime systems, the
		  employment of garbage collection techniques for resource
		  management and isolation, and a model for direct sharing of
		  objects between untrusted applications. The difficulty in
		  designing KaffeOS lay in balancing the goals of isolation and
		  resource management against the goal of allowing direct
		  sharing of objects.For the SpecJVM benchmarks, the overhead
		  that our KaffeOS prototype incurs ranges from 0&percent; to
		  25&percent;, when compared to the open-source JVM on which it
		  is based. We consider this overhead acceptable for the safety
		  that KaffeOS provides. In addition, our KaffeOS prototype can
		  scale to run more applications than running multiple
		  JVMs. Finally, in the presence of malicious or buggy code
		  that engages in a denial-of-service attack, KaffeOS can
		  contain the attack, remove resources from the attacked
		  applications, and continue to provide robust service to other
		  clients.",

		  description language) was developed under the auspices of the
		  US Department of Defense's Very High Speed Integrated
		  Circuits (VHSIC) program in the 1980s. The current DoD
		  effort, called RASSP (Rapid Prototyping of

		  undertaking to reduce, by a factor of four, the cost and time
		  needed to design, upgrade, and replace embedded digital
		  signal processors. To reach this goal, VHDL and its
		  extensions must be used throughout the design process and at
		  all levels from system to gate. VHDL has a number of
		  constructs that have direct correlations in digital hardware;
		  the most important are the component, which encapsulates a
		  "black box" view of a piece of hardware, and the signal,
		  which models a wire. Such constructs make VHDL suitable for
		  developing detailed low-level models, but they make it
		  difficult to write abstract high-level models. For
		  system-level descriptions of behavior, a computation model
		  more in line with software systems seems suitable. In this
		  model, individual modules are reactive; that is, they respond
		  only to a command/instruction or stimulus, communication is
		  point-to-point, and the individual addressability of modules
		  allows for temporary implicit communication pathways without
		  the specificity of ports and interconnections. OO-VHDL, the
		  object-oriented extension language of VHDL described in this
		  article, supports both the VHDL computation model and the
		  reactive computation model. The authors have implemented a
		  preprocessor that translates OO-VHDL to VHDL and a debugging
		  tool that maps VHDL statements into the OO-VHDL statements
		  from which they were derived. Thus, modelers will be able to
		  use OO-VHDL in current VHDL environments.},

		  addresses these decisions in distinct phases. The compiler

		  network. Communication operations can be either
		  point-to-point, with one source and one destination, or
		  collective, with more than two participating processes. The
		  design of collective communication operations depends on the
		  MPC's underlying network architecture. While there has been
		  little consensus on some aspects of communication
		  architectures, such as network topology, a good deal of
		  agreement exists regarding the most efficient way to switch
		  messages through the network. Most MPCs use wormhole routing,
		  in which each message is divided into small pieces that are
		  pipelined through the network. Compared with the
		  store-and-forward switching method used in early
		  multicomputers, wormhole routing reduces the effect of path
		  length on communication time. However, in situations where
		  multiple messages exist in the network concurrently, wormhole
		  routing can exacerbate channel contention, which occurs when
		  blocked messages hold some communication channels while
		  waiting for others. Invoking a collective operation, which
		  can involve many messages, poses this situation. In recent
		  years, many projects have addressed the design of efficient
		  collective communication algorithms for wormhole-routed
		  systems. By exploiting the relative distance-insensitivity of
		  wormhole routing, these new algorithms often differ
		  fundamentally from their store-and-forward counterparts. This
		  article examines software and hardware approaches to
		  implementing collective communication operations,
		  illustrating several issues arising in this research area and

    perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet

    research addressing packet classification, algorithmic and architectural.
    A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided
    complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions.
    Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many
    offering new algorithms and improvements on existing algorithms.  Given the
    inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by
    high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised
    architectural solutions to the problem.  This thread of research produced
    the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary
    Content Addressable Memory (TCAM).  New architectural research combines
    intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the
    unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs.  We observe that the

		  applications and served multiple users, leading to heightened
		  awareness of data security issues. System administrators and
		  software developers focused on different kinds of access
		  control to ensure that only authorized users were given
		  access to certain data or resources. One kind of access
		  control that emerged is role-based access control (RBAC). A
		  role is chiefly a semantic construct forming the basis of
		  access control policy. With RBAC, system administrators
		  create roles according to the job functions performed in a
		  company or organization, grant permissions (access
		  authorization) to those roles, and then assign users to the
		  roles on the basis of their specific job responsibilities and
		  qualifications. A role can represent specific task
		  competency, such as that of a physician or a pharmacist. Or
		  it can embody the authority and responsibility of, say, a
		  project supervisor. Roles define both the specific
		  individuals allowed to access resources and the extent to
		  which resources are accessed. For example, an operator role
		  might access all computer resources but not change access
		  permissions; a security-officer role might change permissions
		  but have no access to resources; and an auditor role might
		  access only audit trails. Roles are used for system
		  administration in such network operating systems as Novell's
		  NetWare and Microsoft's Windows NT. This article explains why
		  RBAC is receiving renewed attention as a method of security
		  administration and review, describes a framework of four
		  reference models the authors have developed to better
		  understand RBAC and categorize different implementations, and
		  discusses the use of RBAC to manage itself. The authors'
		  framework separates the administration of RBAC from its
		  access control functions.",

		  network. The communication delay is finite but
		  unpredictable. A process's actions are modeled as three types
		  of events: internal, message send, and message receive. An
		  internal event affects only the process at which it occurs,
		  and the events at a process are linearly ordered by their
		  order of occurrence. Send and receive events signify the flow

		  dependency from the sender process to the receiver

		  partial order on the events of a distributed
		  computation. Causality among events, more formally the causal
		  precedence relation, is a powerful concept for reasoning,
		  analyzing, and drawing inferences about a distributed
		  computation. Knowledge of the causal precedence relation

		  of processing elements that are massively interconnected and
		  that exchange signals. Processing within elements usually
		  involves adding weighted input values, applying a (non)linear
		  function to the input sum, and forwarding the result to other
		  elements. Since the basic principle of neurocomputation is
		  learning by example, such processing must be repeated again
		  and again, with weights being changed until a network learns
		  the problem. An artificial neural network can be implemented
		  as a simulation programmed on a general-purpose computer or
		  as an emulation realized on special-purpose hardware.
		  Although sequential simulations are widespread and offer
		  comfortable software environments for developing and
		  analyzing neural networks, the computational needs of
		  realistic applications exceed the capabilities of sequential
		  computers.  Parallelization was therefore necessary to cope 
		  with the high computational and communication demands of
		  neuro-applications. As matrix-vector operations are at the
		  core of many neuroalgorithms, processing is often organized
		  in such a way as to ensure their efficient implementation.
		  The first implementations were exercised on general-purpose
		  parallel machines.  When they approached the performance
		  limits of standard supercomputers, the research focus shifted
		  to architectural improvements. One approach was to build
		  general-purpose programmable neurohardware; another was to
		  construct special-purpose neurohardware that emulates a
		  particular neuromodel. This article discusses techniques and
		  means for parallelizing neurosimulations, both at a high
		  programming level and at a low hardware-emulation level.",

		  interoperability, while leaving implementers a large amount
		  of leeway to optimize performance and to provide choices in
		  service performance profiles.  The authors' initial

		  of combining the advantages of object orientation and
		  database programming to yield a powerful and universal
		  programming language design.  A uniform and consistent
		  combination of object orientation and database programming,
		  however, is not straightforward.  Since one of the main
		  components of an object-oriented programming language is its
		  type system, one of the first problems that arises during an
		  OODBPL design is related to the development of a uniform,
		  consistent, and theoretically sound type system that is
		  sufficiently expressive to satisfy the combined needs of
		  object orientation and database programming.The purpose of
		  this article is to answer two questions: "What are the
		  requirements that a modern type system for an object-oriented
		  database programming language should satisfy?" and "Are there
		  any type systems developed to-date that satisfy these
		  requirements?".  In order to answer the first question, we
		  compile the set of requirements that an OODBPL type system
		  should satisfy.  We then use this set of requirements to
		  evaluate more than 30 existing type systems.  The result of
		  this extensive analysis shows that while each of the
		  requirements is satisfied by at least one type system, no
		  type system satisfies all of them.  It also enables
		  identification of the mechanisms that lie behind the
		  strengths and weaknesses of the current type systems.},

		  Our parser generator builds on recent research on parsing
		  expression grammars (PEGs), which, by being closed under
		  composition, prioritizing choices, supporting unlimited
		  lookahead, and integrating lexing and parsing, offer an 
		  attractive alternative to context-free grammars.  PEGs are
		  implemented by so-called packrat parsers, which are recursive
		  descent parsers that memoize all intermediate results (hence
		  their name).  Memoization ensures linear-time performance in
		  the presence of unlimited lookahead, but also results in an
		  essentially lazy, functional parsing technique.  In this
		  paper, we explore how to leverage PEGs and packrat parsers as
		  the foundation for extensible syntax.  In particular, we show
		  how make packrat parsing more widely applicable by
		  implementing this lazy, functional technique in a strict,
		  imperative language, while also generating better performing
		  parsers through aggressive optimizations.  Next, we develop a
		  module system for organizing, modifying, and composing
		  large-scale syntactic specifications.  Finally, we describe a
		  new technique for managing (global) parsing state in
		  functional parsers.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
		  that the resulting parser generator succeeds at providing
		  extensible syntax.  In particular, Rats! enables other
		  grammar writers to realize real-world language extensions in
		  little time and code, and it generates parsers that
		  consistently out-perform parsers created by two GLR parser
		  generators.",

		  performance and over 800 Mbps aggregate throughput using
		  3DES.  We believe that this validates our decision to opt for

		  Furthermore, our evaluation points to several bottlenecks in

		  We identify some of these limitations through a set of

		  complete fault tolerance through a new (and incompatible) OS

		  kernel resources to facilitate automatic cleanup during
		  recovery.To prove the viability of our approach, we
		  implemented Nooks in the Linux operating system and used it
		  to fault-isolate several device drivers.  Our results show
		  that Nooks offers a substantial increase in the reliability
		  of operating systems, catching and quickly recovering from
		  many faults that would otherwise crash the system.  Under a
		  wide range and number of fault conditions, we show that Nooks
		  recovers automatically from 99% of the faults that otherwise
		  cause Linux to crash.  While Nooks was designed for drivers,
		  our techniques generalize to other kernel extensions.  We
		  demonstrate this by isolating a kernel-mode file system and
		  an in-kernel Internet service.  Overall, because Nooks
		  supports existing C-language extensions, runs on a commodity
		  operating system and hardware, and enables automated
		  recovery, it represents a substantial step beyond the

		  on Prescriptive Formal Models (PFMs) that capture the
		  specification of the system under design in a mathematically
		  precise manner.  Such models can be used as golden reference
		  models for formal verification, test generation, coverage
		  monitor generation, etc.  This methodology for incrementally
		  building PFMs works by adding user stories expressed as LTL
		  formulae gleaned from the natural language specifications,
		  one by one, into the model.  XFM builds the models, retaining
		  correctness with respect to incrementally added properties by
		  regressively model-checking all the LTL properties captured
		  theretofore in the model.  We illustrate XFM with a graded
		  set of examples consisting of a traffic light controller and
		  a DLX pipeline.  To make the regressive model-checking steps
		  feasible with current model-checking tools, we need to
		  control the model size increments at each subsequent step in
		  the process.  We therefore analyze the effects of ordering
		  the LTL properties in XFM on the statespace growth rate of
		  the model.  We compare three different property-ordering
		  methodologies: ad hoc ordering, property-based ordering, and
		  predicate-based ordering.  We experiment on the models of the
		  ISA bus monitor and the arbitration phase of the Pentium Pro
		  bus.  We experimentally show and mathematically reason that
		  the predicate-based ordering is the best among these
		  orderings.  Finally, we present a GUI-based toolbox that we
		  implemented to build PFMs using XFM.",

		  So far the theories of automata and of nets, though most
		  interesting for dynamics, have formalized only a portion of
		  the field, and there has been perhaps too much concentration
		  on the finite-state and algebraic aspects.  It would seem
		  that the understanding of higher-level program features
		  involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass
		  through several levels of explanation to go from the
		  conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine.
		  These levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find
		  the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
		  The experience of many independent workers with the method of
		  data types as lattices (or partial orderings) under an
		  information content ordering, and with their continuous
		  mappings, has demonstrated the flexibility of this approach
		  in providing definitions and proofs, which are clean and
		  without undue dependence on implementations.  Nevertheless
		  much remains to be done in showing how abstract
		  conceptualizations can (or cannot) be actualized before we
		  can say we have a unified theory.",

		  large OO projects, late integration problems are a particular
		  concern.  They can cause schedule slippage and other
		  difficulties.  I developed a process called Traceability for
		  OO Quality Engineering, or TOOQE, to minimize such problems.
		  TOOQE emphasizes traceability and the integration of
		  development and testing to achieve quality and
		  maintainability.  TOOQE features an iterative design process
		  that lets developers correct mistakes and learn more about
		  the problem they are trying to solve as they go along.  Each
		  iteration includes requirements capture, analysis, design,
		  coding, and testing.  In other words, each is a mini-life
		  cycle.  TOOQE's approach is also incremental. This lets each
		  iteration build on its predecessor and eliminates the need to
		  retest functionality at each iteration.  Integration does not
		  occur late in the process in TOOQE but instead occurs at each
		  iteration.  Moreover, integration entails immediate testing
		  of the integrated artifacts, thus providing early and
		  continuous feedback.  For object-oriented analysis and
		  design, you use three views of the system.  The expression of
		  each view requires at least one model, so OOA and OOD lead to
		  the production of several models.",

		  recognize complex character patterns and represent imprecise,

		  classical computing problem, dating back to neural
		  computing's infancy.  One of Frank Rosenblatt's first
		  demonstrations on the Mark I Perceptron neurocomputer in the
		  late 1950s involved character recognition.  The Perceptron
		  was one of the first computers based on the idea of a neural
		  network, which is a simplified computational model of neurons
		  in a human brain.  It was the first functioning
		  neurocomputer, and it was able to recognize a fixed-font
		  character set.  As with many artificial intelligence
		  applications, the difficulty of handwriting recognition was
		  greatly underestimated.  Significant progress was not
		  achieved until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when many
		  technologies converged to enable rapid increases in
		  recognition rates for digits, characters, and words so that
		  reliable commercial systems could be developed.  Handwriting
		  recognition problems are either online or offline.  Online
		  recognition systems use a pressure-sensitive pad that records
		  the pen's pressure and velocity, which would be the case
		  with, for example, a personal digital assistant.  In offline
		  recognition, the kind we are concerned with here, system
		  input is a digital image of handwritten letters and numbers.
		  Handwriting recognition requires tools and techniques that
		  recognize complex character patterns and represent imprecise,
		  commonsense knowledge about the general appearance of
		  characters, words, and phrases.  Neural networks and fuzzy
		  logic are complementary tools for solving such problems.
		  Neural networks, which are highly nonlinear and highly
		  interconnected for processing imprecise information, can
		  finely approximate complicated decision boundaries.  Fuzzy
		  set methods can represent degrees of truth or belonging.
		  Fuzzy logic, one of several fuzzy set methods, encodes
		  imprecise knowledge and naturally maintains multiple
		  hypotheses that result from the uncertainty and vagueness
		  inherent in real problems.  By combining the complementary
		  strengths of neural and fuzzy approaches into a hybrid
		  system, we can attain increased recognition capability for
		  solving handwriting recognition problems.  This article
		  describes the application of neural and fuzzy methods to
		  three problems:recognition of handwritten words,recognition
		  of numeric fields, andlocation of handwritten street numbers
		  in address images.  These problems and methods were part of
		  research we conducted on US Postal Service data and on

		  Most of these mobile user devices need security for their
		  prospective electronic commerce applications. While new
		  technology has simplified many business and personal
		  transactions, it has also opened the door to high-tech crime.
		  In this article, we investigate design options for mobile
		  user devices that are used in legally significant
		  applications.  Such applications authorize transactions:
		  mobile phone calls, access to an office or car, electronic
		  payment in stores, retrieval of stored medical data, and
		  access to information on portable computers.  Digital
		  signatures-the electronic equivalent of handwritten
		  signatures-are at the core of most of these applications and
		  are explained briefly in the "Digital Signatures" sidebar.  A
		  trustworthy mobile user device should suit its purpose well
		  and have credible quality.  Because mobile user devices act
		  on someone's behalf, we use the analogy of agents to describe
		  approaches to security.  There are three types of agent
		  trustworthiness: Personal-agent trust.  Here, the device must
		  act according to the user's wishes while it is in the user's
		  hands. For example, it should not sign unintended statements
		  or unintentionally delete electronic money.  Captured-agent
		  trust.  In this case, the user is protected even if the
		  mobile user device is lost, stolen, or given away (inserted
		  into a point-of-sale terminal or sent away for maintenance).
		  For example, the finder or thief should not be able to sign
		  statements in the legitimate user's name. Undercover-agent
		  trust.  In this case the mobile user devices will protect a
		  third party from the device's legitimate user.  For example,
		  in prepaid offline payment systems users have so-called
		  "electronic cash" in their mobile user devices, which they
		  can use without connecting to a bank.  The bank wants the
		  mobile user device to prevent its legitimate user from
		  "spending" the same bit string in several shops.  Contrary to
		  popular belief, undercover-agent trust is not needed in many
		  applications, including online payment systems and general
		  signature applications.  A mobile user device by itself may
		  not be able to keep data secret or uncorrupted-it may not be
		  tamper-resistant.  A tamper-resistant device is called a
		  security module, whether the security mechanism is on a
		  separate device or incorporated into the mobile user device
		  itself.  Such devices secure "mobile" applications and
		  applications on stationary devices like PCs and public
		  kiosks, if all security-relevant actions are controlled via
		  the trustworthy mobile device.},

		  the ability to modify very small details of an operating
		  system, which makes it easy to tailor the system to the
		  application. There has been an explosion of applications over
		  the last few years.  The behavior of modern applications,
		  such as multimedia packages, parallel applications, and
		  groupware, is diverse.  Yet the operating systems they run on
		  are usually optimized for an "average" application.
		  Designing a general-purpose operating system that provides
		  the best performance for every application is difficult.  My
		  experience indicates that optimizing an operating system for
		  the general case can result in mediocre performance for
		  specialized applications, especially parallel applications.
		  Therefore, I envision a customizable operating system built
		  from components that will allow an optimal match between
		  application behavior and hardware architecture.  I propose an
		  object-oriented operating system in which design frameworks
		  support alternative implementations of key systems software
		  services.  The most challenging part of designing a framework
		  is to make it reconfigurable.  For example, a configuration
		  rule might improve an application's performance by replacing
		  some of the operating system's data structures with
		  subclasses of those structures. I propose a reconfigurable
		  framework that implements different policies, depending on
		  the framework subclass used.  There are other approaches to
		  customization.  Compilers can be used when there is
		  considerable information about an application domain.  Design
		  patterns are a mechanism for specifying designs that are at a
		  higher level than frameworks.  Frameworks fall somewhere
		  between a compiler-based approach and design patterns.  In my
		  approach, each framework separates implementation details
		  from the subset design, which is expressed as a set of
		  abstract classes and their interrelationships.  To customize
		  its support, the operating system uses hints supplied by the
		  application and a monitoring system to select the subclasses
		  that are best suited to the application.  Here I illustrate
		  the method with a parallel application.},

		  Traditionally, this is achieved by physically carrying a
		  computing device (say, a laptop or PDA) which may have some
		  form of intermittent network connectivity, either wireless or
		  tethered. However, at the Olivetti and Oracle Research
		  Laboratory, we have introduced another form of mobility in
		  which it is the user's applications that are mobile.1 Users
		  do not carry any computing platform but instead bring up
		  their applications on any nearby machine exactly as they
		  appeared when last invoked. We call this form of mobility
		  teleporting, and it has been used continuously and fruitfully
		  by many members of our laboratory for the past three
		  years. Clearly, teleporting to these machines requires that
		  they be networked and that they provide a common interface at
		  some level.  In our case, we use our local area network
		  (Ethernet and ATM), with X Windows serving as the common
		  interface.  When we teleport, our personal X session-with all
		  its associated applications in their latest collective
		  state-is transferred from one host's display to another
		  within the lab.  For example, we can walk into someone else's
		  office and immediately call up and interact with our personal

		  working environments currently displayed there.  We are

		  Sloth is a collection of UNIX shell commands for creating and
		  editing modules, and for producing executables by linking
		  compiled code from the modules comprising a program.Sloth in
		  a sense extends C by providing module facilities similar to
		  those built in to newer languages such as Modula-II.  The
		  Sloth `extensions', however, are at the shell level
		  only. No changes are required in C itself; in fact, the Sloth
		  commands invoke the standard Unix C compiler.  A Sloth module
		  contains a set of C procedures and local declarations, a set
		  of global definitions and variable declarations, an
		  initialization routine and an `import' list of other modules
		  containing declarations referred to, but not defined by, the
		  module in question.  The Sloth link command has one argument,
		  the name of a `root' directory.  The link command
		  automatically identifies all those modules imported directly
		  or indirectly by the root module, checks that the object code
		  for each module is up-to-date and recompiles where
		  necessary. It then creates a main program in which the
		  various initialization routines are executed in the correct
		  order (most primitive first), compiles it and links it with
		  all the object files and produces an executable program.
		  Individual modules can be compiled without any knowledge of
		  the application that uses, directly or indirectly, the module
		  in question.  Two applications that both use a collection of
		  modules can therefore share the object code for these
		  modules.The use and implementation of Sloth are presented, as

		  power is growing much more rapidly than the speed of I/O

		  Common practices in publish/subscribe, however, include

		  latency make it difficult to identify the causes of failures
		  in the operational environment.  It is particularly hard to
		  recreate a failure scenario for a large, complex system. To
		  identify and understand potential failures, the authors use
		  an experiment-based approach for studying system
		  dependability.  This approach is applied during the
		  conception, design, prototype, and operational phases.  To
		  take an experiment-based approach, you must first understand
		  a system's architecture, structure, and behavior.  You need
		  to know its tolerance for faults and failures, including its
		  built-in detection and recovery mechanisms,and you need
		  specific instruments and tools to inject faults, create
		  failures or errors, and monitor their effects.  Engineers
		  most often use low-cost, simulation-based fault injection to
		  evaluate the dependability of a system that is in the
		  conceptual and design phases.  At this point, the system
		  under study is only a series of high-level abstractions;
		  implementation details have yet to be determined.  Thus the
		  system is simulated on the basis of simplified assumptions.
		  Simulation-based fault injection, which assumes that errors
		  or failures occur according to predetermined distribution, is
		  useful for evaluating the effectiveness of fault-tolerant
		  mechanisms and a system's dependability; it does provide
		  timely feedback to system engineers.  However, it requires
		  accurate input parameters, which are difficult to supply:
		  Design and technology changes often complicate the use of
		  past measurements.  Testing a prototype, on the other hand,
		  allows you to evaluate the system without any assumptions
		  about system design.  Instead of injecting faults, engineers
		  can directly measure operational systems as they handle real
		  workloads.Measurement-based analysis uses actual data, which
		  contains much information about naturally occurring errors
		  and failures and sometimes about recovery attempts.  Although
		  these three experimental methods have limitations, their
		  unique values complement one another and allow for a wide
		  spectrum of dependability studies.",

		  breaks (faults).  An integrated approach, their network
		  management strategy combines temporal and spatial redundancy.
		  Temporal redundancy migrates messages on faulty routes to
		  fault-free ones.  Spatial redundancy tries to overcome faults
		  by sending multiple copies of messages, hoping that if one
		  copy gets lost, others will reach their destination.  Based
		  on four message characteristics-length, period, deadline, and
		  fault-tolerance limit-algorithms perform network management
		  functions.  To minimize network overhead, the authors'

		  and an array of security and payment options that confuses

		  framework should be able to shop for, purchase, and pay for
		  goods and services offered on a different framework.  This is
		  currently not possible.  In response, CommerceNet is
		  organizing Eco System, a cross-industry effort to build a

		  and end users.  The success of Eco depends on market leaders

		  or timing information for an experiment.  Thus, while Java
		  and the Web support dynamic interactions and enable exciting
		  capabilities in educational software, few applications built
		  on them exploit these capabilities.  This article describes
		  CSLab, a proof-of-concept prototype of a simulation
		  environment that is easy to use, dynamic, and Web-accessible.
		  It is designed from the ground up to exploit the inherent
		  dynamic behavior of Java and the Web and to let end users
		  capitalize on this behavior.  The authors' goal was to build
		  a framework within which to create, configure, and execute
		  experiments, but instead of the physical sciences they
		  focused on experimental algorithmics.  The CSLab executable
		  is a framework for creating various simulation experiments
		  using available modules.},

		  evolutionary improvements have occurred in the basic RPC
		  system, leading to improved systems-such as NCS (T.H.  Dineen
		  et al., 1987)-that offer programmers more functionality or

		  Invocation system has many of the same features of other RPC
		  systems, letting an object running in one Java virtual
		  machine make a method call on an object running in another,
		  perhaps on a different physical machine. On the surface, the
		  RMI system is just another RPC mechanism, much like Corba and
		  DCOM.  But on closer inspection, RMI represents a very
		  different evolutionary progression, one that results in a
		  system that differs not just in detail but in the very set of
		  assumptions made about the distributed systems in which it

		  supporting subprogram RPC parameters is harderthan supporting
		  non-subprogram RPC parameters, the three (of six) components

		  any scope potentially referenced by a subprogram passed as an
		  RPCparameter.  In addition to the usual call- and
		  accept-stubs and the marshaling and unmarshaling routines,

		  networks must meet conflicting, interdependent requirements.
		  This sets the stage for a complex problem with a solution
		  that targets optimal topological connections, routing, and
		  link capacity assignments.  These assignments must minimize
		  cost while satisfying traffic requirements and keeping
		  network delays within permissible values.  Since such a
		  problem is NP-complete (one which has a solution in

		  complexity and solve practical problems with a modest number
		  of nodes.  The heuristic methods used to design mesh networks
		  include branch exchange, cut saturation, and Mentor

		  algorithms,1,2 appear ideal to design mesh networks with
		  capability of handling discrete values, multiobjective

		  algorithmic simplicity, but also its ability to handle
		  complicated issues such as continuous and discrete link
		  capacities, linear or discrete cost structures, additional
		  constraints, and various constraint models.  We believe our

		  programming tool explicitly supports them.  In programming,
		  as in other kinds of engineering design, simplifying
		  assumptions are an important method for dealing with
		  complexity.  Given a complex programming problem, expert
		  programmers typically choose simplifying assumptions which,
		  though false, allow them to arrive rapidly at a program which
		  addresses the important features of the problem without being
		  distracted by all of its details.  The simplifying
		  assumptions are then incrementally retracted with
		  corresponding modifications to the initial program.  This
		  methodology is particularly applicable to rapid prototyping
		  because the main questions of interest can often be answered
		  using only the initial program.Simplifying assumptions can
		  easily be misused.  In order to use them effectively two key
		  issues must be addressed.  First, simplifying assumptions
		  should be chosen which simplify the design problem
		  significantly without changing the essential character of the
		  program which needs to be implemented.  Second, the designer
		  must keep track of all the assumptions he is making so that
		  he can later retract them in an orderly manner.  By
		  explicitly dealing with these issues, a programming assistant
		  system could directly support the use of simplifying
		  assumptions as a disciplined part of the software development
		  process.",

		  but rather requires users to provide (input -> output)
		  samples that describe the behavior of their needed algorithm.
		  The system is easy to use.  To search for a particular
		  algorithm or classify a combinatorial structure a user simply
		  draws the query in a drawing pane on a web browser. The
		  result of the search is a list of links to web resources
		  describing or providing implementations of the algorithm.
		  AlgoVista has many interesting applications in an educational
		  setting.  The search engine can help research students
		  classify obscure problems and locate algorithms that would
		  otherwise be hard to find in textbooks.  Students can also
		  add calls in their own programs to AlgoVista's database of
		  executable problem specifications in order to dynamically
		  check the correctness of their programs.  Finally,
		  instructors can use AlgoVista to set novel assignments in
		  algorithms and data structures classes.This paper briefly
		  describes AlgoVista and reports on its use in two algorithms
		  and theory classes, one at the undergraduate and one at the

  viewing and editing, rather than on programming.  yet the need for end-user
  programming continues to grow.  software developers have responded to the
  demand with a barrage of customizable applications and operating systems.
  but the learning curve associated with a high level of customizability-even
  in gui-based operating systems-often prevents users from easily modifying
  their software. ironically, the question has become, "what is the easiest way
  for end users to program?" perhaps the best way to customize a program, given
  current interface and software design, is for users to annotate
  tasks-verbally or via the keyboard-as they are executing them.  experiments
  have shown that users can "teach" a computer most easily by demonstrating a
  desired behavior.  but the teaching approach raises new questions about how
  the system, as a learning machine, will correlate, generalize, and
  disambiguate a user's instructions. to understand how best to create a system
  that can learn, the authors conducted an experiment in which users attempt to
  train an intelligent agent to edit a bibliography.  armed with the results of
  these experiments, the authors implemented an interactive machine learning
  system, which they call configurable instructible machine architecture.
  designed to acquire behavior concepts from few examples, cima keeps users
  informed and allows them to influence the course of learning.  programming by
  demonstration reduces boring, repetitive work.  perhaps the most important
  lesson the authors learned is the value of involving users in the design
  process.  by testing and critiquing their design ideas, users keep the
  designers focused on their objective: agents that make computer-based work

  abstract     = {Garbage collection yields numerous software engineering
  benefits, but its quantitative impact on performance remains elusive.  One
  can compare the cost of conservative garbage collection to explicit memory
  management in C/C++ programs by linking in an appropriate collector.  This
  kind of direct comparison is not possible for languages designed for garbage
  collection (e.g., Java), because programs in these languages naturally do not
  contain calls to free.  Thus, the actual gap between the time and space
  performance of explicit memory management and precise, copying garbage
  collection remains unknown.We introduce a novel experimental methodology that
  lets us quantify the performance of precise garbage collection versus
  explicit memory management. Our system allows us to treat unaltered Java
  programs as if they used explicit memory management by relying on oracles to
  insert calls to free.  These oracles are generated from profile information
  gathered in earlier application runs. By executing inside an
  architecturally-detailed simulator, this "oracular" memory manager eliminates
  the effects of consulting an oracle while measuring the costs of calling
  malloc and free.  We evaluate two different oracles: a liveness-based oracle
  that aggressively frees objects immediately after their last use, and a
  reachability-based oracle that conservatively frees objects just after they
  are last reachable.  These oracles span the range of possible placement of
  explicit deallocation calls.We compare explicit memory management to both
  copying and non-copying garbage collectors across a range of benchmarks using
  the oracular memory manager, and present real (non-simulated) runs that lend
  further validity to our results.  These results quantify the time-space
  tradeoff of garbage collection: with five times as much memory, an
  Appel-style generational collector with a non-copying mature space matches
  the performance of reachability-based explicit memory management.  With only
  three times as much memory, the collector runs on average 17% slower than
  explicit memory management.  However, with only twice as much memory, garbage
  collection degrades performance by nearly 70%.  When physical memory is
  scarce, paging causes garbage collection to run an order of magnitude slower
  than explicit memory management.},

    notoriously hard to write.  To alleviate this difficulty, we have
    implemented a tool which automatically derives documentation in the form of
    formal specifications.  Our tool probes Java classes by invoking them on
    dynamically generated tests and captures the information observed during
    their execution as algebraic axioms.  While the tool is not complete or
    correct from a formal perspective we demonstrate that it discovers many
    useful axioms when applied to container classes.  These axioms then form an
    initial formal documentation of the class they describe.",

    distilling algorithm with a benchmark we developed that consists of 1,064
    manually classified changes in 219 revisions from three different open
    source projects.  We achieved significant improvements in extracting types
    of source code changes: our algorithm approximates the minimum edit script
    by 45% better than the original change extraction approach by Chawathe et
    al.  We are able to find all occurring changes and almost reach the minimum
    conforming edit script, i.e., we reach a mean absolute percentage error of

    information is generally implicit in the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    diagrams of the applications. It is unclear in which pattern instances each
    modeling element, such as class, attribute, and operation, participates.
    It is hard for a designer to find the design patterns used in an
    application design.  Consequently, the benefits of design patterns are
    compromised because designers cannot communicate with each other in terms
    of the design patterns they used and their design decisions and trade-offs.
    In this paper, we present a UML profile that defines new stereotypes,
    tagged values, and constraints for tracing design patterns in UML diagrams.
    These new stereotypes and tagged values are attached to a modeling element
    to explicitly represent the role the modeling element plays in a design
    pattern so that the user can identify the pattern in a UML diagram.  Based
    on this profile, we also develop a Web service (tool) for explicitly
    visualizing design patterns in UML diagrams.  With this service, users are
    able to visualize design patterns in their applications and compositions
    because pattern-related information can be dynamically displayed.  A
    real-world case study and a comparative experiment with existing approaches
    are conducted to evaluate our approach.",

    electrical and computer engineering (ECE), some educators argue that they
    should deliberately not respond aggressively.  Rather, educators should
    focus on fundamentals that will serve the students well for an entire
    career. Although the authors agree, they go on to explain that this
    approach largely begs the question of what those fundamentals are.  Of
    course, it is desirable to impart all feasible fundamentals, but that seems
    impossible given the expanding breadth of knowledge required in the ECE
    field.  Thus, the question this article addresses is: What are the
    fundamental skills and knowledge that are important for a future career in
    ECE? What should be the educational priorities? The authors believe that
    the center of gravity of most undergraduate curricula today is too far on
    the side of attempting to train the small cadre of technical experts, a
    hopeless task within a four- or five-year program.  The authors advocate an
    alternative vision in which the undergraduate program focuses on a limited
    and carefully chosen set of core ideas, supplemented by real-world examples
    and importantly by student self-exploration and learning.  Such an
    undergraduate program also emphasizes breadth, an exposure to a range of
    technical issues, as well as mathematics, science, humanities and social
    sciences.  After the undergraduate experience, the students divide
    themselves into several groups: one group chooses to leave with an
    undergraduate degree; a second group stays for a master's degree; while the

    exploited to identify a feasible solution of the problem, if one does not

    Unfortunately, there may be insufficient resources to allow for the
    reexecution of all test cases during regression testing.  In this
    situation, test case prioritization techniques aim to improve the
    effectiveness of regression testing by ordering the test cases so that the
    most beneficial are executed first.  Previous work on regression test case
    prioritization has focused on Greedy Algorithms. However, it is known that
    these algorithms may produce suboptimal results because they may construct
    results that denote only local minima within the search space.  By
    contrast, metaheuristic and evolutionary search algorithms aim to avoid
    such problems.  This paper presents results from an empirical study of the
    application of several greedy, metaheuristic, and evolutionary search
    algorithms to six programs, ranging from 374 to 11,148 lines of code for
    three choices of fitness metric.  The paper addresses the problems of
    choice of fitness metric, characterization of landscape modality, and
    determination of the most suitable search technique to apply.  The
    empirical results replicate previous results concerning Greedy Algorithms.
    They shed light on the nature of the regression testing search space,
    indicating that it is multimodal.  The results also show that Genetic
    Algorithms perform well, although Greedy approaches are surprisingly
    effective, given the multimodal nature of the landscape.",

    multilegged arguments to support dependability claims about software-based
    systems.  The informal justification for the use of multilegged arguments
    is similar to that used to support the use of multiversion software in
    pursuit of high reliability or safety.  Just as a diverse 1-out-of-2 system
    might be expected to be more reliable than each of its two component
    versions, so might a two-legged argument be expected to give greater
    confidence in the correctness of a dependability claim (for example, a
    safety claim) than would either of the argument legs alone.  Our intention
    here is to treat these argument structures formally, in particular, by
    presenting a formal probabilistic treatment of "confidence," which will be
    used as a measure of efficacy.  This will enable claims for the efficacy of
    the multilegged approach to be made quantitatively, answering questions
    such as, "How much extra confidence about a system's safety will I have if
    I add a verification argument leg to an argument leg based upon statistical
    testing?" For this initial study, we concentrate on a simplified and
    idealized example of a safety system in which interest centers upon a claim
    about the probability of failure on demand.  Our approach is to build a
    "Bayesian belief network" (BBN) model of a two-legged argument and
    manipulate this analytically via parameters that define its node
    probability tables.  The aim here is to obtain greater insight than what is
    afforded by the more usual BBN treatment, which involves merely numerical
    manipulation.  We show that the addition of a diverse second argument leg
    can indeed increase confidence in a dependability claim; in a reasonably
    plausible example, the doubt in the claim is reduced to one-third of the
    doubt present in the original single leg. However, we also show that there
    can be some unexpected and counterintuitive subtleties here; for example,
    an entirely supportive second leg can sometimes undermine a- n original
    argument, resulting, overall, in less confidence than what came from this
    original argument.  Our results are neutral on the issue of whether such
    difficulties will arise in real life - that is, when real experts judge
    real systems.},

    applications. These large functions present challenges to modern compilers
    not only because they require more time and resources at compilation time,
    but also because they may prevent optimizations such as function inlining.
    Often large portions of the code in a hot function f[host] are executed
    much less frequently than f[host] itself.  Partial inlining is a natural
    solution to the problems caused by including cold code segments that are
    seldom executed into hot functions that are frequently invoked.  When
    applying partial inlining, a compiler outlines cold statements from a hot
    function f [host].  After outlining, f[host] becomes smaller and thus can
    be easily inlined.  This paper presents Ablego, a framework for function
    outlining and partial inlining that includes several innovations: (1) an
    abstract-syntax-tree-based analysis and transformation to form cold regions
    for outlining; (2) a set of flexible heuristics to control the
    aggressiveness of function outlining; (3) several possible function
    outlining strategies; (4) explicit variable spilling, a new technique that
    overcomes negative side-effects of function outlining.  With the proper
    strategy, partial inlining improves performance by up to 5.75%.  A
    performance study also suggests that partial inlining's effect on enabling
    more aggressive inlining is limited.  The performance improvement from
    partial inlining actually comes from better code placement and better code
    generation.",

    dimensions.  This article describes developments in holographic 3D
    memories, in which high density is achieved by superimposing many holograms
    within the same volume of recording material. Holographic storage is a
    promising candidate for next-generation storage. Research has demonstrated
    that holographic storage systems with desirable properties can be
    engineered.  The next step is to build these systems at costs competitive
    with those of existing technologies and to optimize the storage media.",

    about the future of optics.  Optics is dead, he says, only if we foolishly
    believe that its role is to replace electronics. All-optical computers are
    not the goal.  In fact, the very concept is specious: an all-optical
    computer cannot import, modify or export information.  So, the huge
    effort that has gone into the competition between optics and electronics
    has been a tragic waste of time, money and talent.  Both optics and
    electronics have roles, but they are not the same.  Whenever an
    optoelectronic computer competes directly with an electronic computer, it
    loses.  Electronics is far more mature, far cheaper, far better funded.
    The hope for optics lies in doing things which are provably impossible for
    electronics.  Presuming that such tasks exist and are worthwhile, optics
    plays an essential role.",

    to participate in a controlled experiment on pair programming.  The
    subjects used professional Java tools to perform several change tasks on
    two alternative Java systems with different degrees of complexity.  The
    results of this experiment do not support the hypotheses that pair
    programming in general reduces the time required to solve the tasks
    correctly or increases the proportion of correct solutions.  On the other
    hand, there is a significant 84 percent increase in effort to perform the
    tasks correctly.  However, on the more complex system, the pair programmers
    had a 48 percent increase in the proportion of correct solutions but no
    significant differences in the time taken to solve the tasks correctly.
    For the simpler system, there was a 20 percent decrease in time taken but
    no significant differences in correctness.  However, the moderating effect
    of system complexity depends on the programmer expertise of the subjects.
    The observed benefits of pair programming in terms of correctness on the
    complex system apply mainly to juniors, whereas the reductions in duration
    to perform the tasks correctly on the simple system apply mainly to
    intermediates and seniors.  It is possible that the benefits of pair

    diagram (DFD), called data flow net (DF net), for specifying use-cases
    through functional decomposition.  It proposes a novel approach to
    complement existing OO software development methods with functional
    decomposition for realizing use-cases, especially those with more complex

    realizes use-cases through functional refinement and specifies them in DF
    nets.  In the design and implementation stages, it transforms the DF nets
    systematically and precisely into OO design and implementation.  The
    approach is amenable to automation and a prototype has been developed to
    support the transformation process.  In the development of an OO system, it
    is seamless to realize some of the use-cases using the proposed approach
    and the remaining use-cases in the same target system using any existing OO
    software development methods.",

    Existing static code analyzers are either not scalable to large software

    less than 20 minutes for CP-Miner to identify 190,000 copy-pasted segments
    in Linux and 150,000 in FreeBSD.  Moreover, CP-Miner has detected many new
    bugs in popular operating systems, 49 in Linux and 31 in FreeBSD, most of
    which have since been confirmed by the corresponding developers and have
    been rectified in the following releases.  In addition, we have found some

    Specifically, we analyze the distribution of copy-pasted code by size

    Component software is moving from its original focus on desktop-bound

    capture market leadership by delivering the tangible benefits of component
    standards via distributed component platforms: integrated development and

    complexity involved in building component-based applications.  With DCPs,
    businesses can assign their few highly skilled programmers to component

    assembly tasks.  By making component standards available to the broadest
    possible spectrum of developers, DCPs essentially drive those standards to

    of the system.  In this technique, we develop mappings that exploit
    regularities in system implementation and architectural style.  These
    mappings describe how low-level system events can be interpreted as more
    abstract architectural operations and are formally defined using Colored
    Petri Nets.  In this paper, we describe a system, called DiscoTect, that
    uses these mappings and we introduce the DiscoSTEP mapping language and its
    formal definition.  Two case studies showing the application of DiscoTect
    suggest that the tool is practical to apply to legacy systems and can
    dynamically verify conformance to a preexisting architectural
    specification.",

    what extent automated static analysis can help in the economic production
    of a high-quality product, we have analyzed static analysis faults and test
    and customer-reported failures for three large-scale industrial software
    systems developed at Nortel Networks. The data indicate that automated

    the orthogonal defect classification scheme, we found that automated static
    analysis is effective at identifying assignment and checking faults,
    allowing the later software production phases to focus on more complex,
    functional, and algorithmic faults.  A majority of the defects found by
    automated static analysis appear to be produced by a few key types of
    programmer errors and some of these types have the potential to cause
    security vulnerabilities.  Statistical analysis results indicate the number
    of automated static analysis faults can be effective for identifying

    programming students should be introduced to examples of simple recursive
    structures such as linked lists and methods that process them, before being
    introduced to traditional procedural examples.  Second, we believe that
    this material should be presented before students are introduced to
    structures such as arrays.  In our experience, the early presentation of
    recursive structures provides the opportunity to reinforce the fundamentals
    of defining and using classes and better prepares students to appreciate
    the reasons to use classes to encapsulate access to other data structures

    designed to increase the flexibility of object-oriented type systems with

    provide type safe abstraction over different instantiations of
    parameterized classes, by using `?' to denote unspecified type arguments.
    Thus they essentially unify the distinct families of classes that
    parametric polymorphism introduces. Wildcards are implemented as part of
    the addition of generics to the Java TM programming language, and is thus
    deployed world-wide as part of the reference implementation of the Java
    compiler javac available from Sun Microsystems, Inc. By providing a richer
    type system, wildcards allow for an improved type inference scheme for
    polymorphic method calls.  Moreover, by means of a novel notion of wildcard
    capture, polymorphic methods can be used to give symbolic names to
    unspecified types, in a manner similar to the "open" construct known from
    existential types.  Wildcards show up in numerous places in the Java
    Platform APIs of the newest release, and some of the examples in this paper
    are taken from these APIs.},

    attention.  Many software quality models use only product metrics such as

    that a module's history prior to integration can help predict the
    likelihood of fault discovery during integration and test.  Such module
    reliability predictions can be used to focus review, integration, and
    testing resources on high-risk areas of a system.  They report their

    satisfactory security solutions is disturbing in light of the trend toward
    open and distributed computing, which increases a system's vulnerability to
    attack.  The authors propose basing security solutions instead on a
    multiple single-level security architecture, which uses commercial
    (nonsecure) products for general-purpose computing and special- purpose
    high-assurance devices to separate data at different security levels.  A
    multiple single-level architecture is a viable and practical solution to
    distributed multilevel secure computing.  The keystone of this architecture
    is a trusted device that "pumps" data from a low security level to a higher
    one. The authors describe the software design and assurance argument
    strategy for this device, the Network NRL Pump, which can be used in any

    help developers search for fault locations.  In this paper, we propose a
    new statistical method, called Sober, which automatically localizes
    software faults without any prior knowledge of the program semantics.
    Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated
    with program failures, Sober models the predicate evaluation in both
    correct and incorrect executions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant
    if its evaluation pattern in incorrect executions significantly diverges
    from that in correct ones.  Featuring a rationale similar to that of
    hypothesis testing, Sober quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate
    in a principled way.  We systematically evaluate Sober under the same
    setting as previous studies.  The result clearly demonstrates the
    effectiveness: Sober could help developers locate 68 out of the 130 faults
    in the Siemens suite by examining no more than 10 percent of the code,
    whereas the Cause Transition approach proposed by Holger et al.  [6] and
    the statistical approach by Liblit et al.  [12] locate 34 and 52 faults,
    respectively. Moreover, the effectiveness of Sober is also evaluated in an
    "imperfect world," where the test suite is either inadequate or only
    partially labeled.  The experiments indicate that Sober could achieve
    competitive quality under these harsh circumstances.  Two case studies with
    grep 2.2 and bc 1.06 are reported, which shed light on the applicability of
    Sober on reasonably large programs.},

    the bottom layer machine components and the micro instructions to handle
    them are described by using an abstract data type.  The top layer describes
    the machine instructions in terms of these micro instructions.  <p> Using a
    functional language as specification language has several advantages.  The
    abstraction mechanisms offered by a functional programming language are
    that good that one can abstract from irrelevant details as is required for
    a specification language.  Functional languages have a well-defined
    semantics such that the meaning of the specification is clear as well.
    Moreover, they offer the advantages of a programming language: the compiler
    can check the specification for partial correctness, eliminating for
    example type errors and unbound identifiers (errors which occur in many
    published descriptions).  Furthermore, the specification can be executed
    such that one obtains a prototype implementation almost for free.  Such an
    executable formal specification can, for instance, be used to investigate
    the dynamic behaviour of the described machine.  <p> For a simple machine,
    the proposed description method is compared with several other description
    methods: a traditional style, a denotational semantics and a formal
    specification in the language Z.  To show that the proposed method is
    indeed useful to describe large and complicated machines, the method is

    computer scientists have to focusing on experimentation: The traditional
    scientific method isn't applicable.  The current level of experimentation
    is good enough.  Experiments cost too much.  Demonstrations will suffice.
    There's too much noise in the way.  Progress will slow. Technology changes
    too fast.  You'll never get it published.In contrast, the author argues
    that experimentation would build a reliable base of knowledge and thus
    reduce uncertainty about which theories, methods, and tools are adequate;
    lead to new, useful, and unexpected insights and open whole new areas of
    investigation; and accelerate progress by quickly eliminating fruitless
    approaches, erroneous assumptions, and fads.  Conversely, when we ignore

    measuring programming ability that looks at intermediate programs produced
    over the course of an implementation rather than just the one at the end.
    The intent is to assess a student's ability to produce algorithmically

    words, the goal is to answer question "How close was the student to being
    initially correct?" but not to speak to a student's debugging skills or
    ability to ultimately produce a working program. To produce an IBS, it is
    necessary to inspect a student's online protocol, which is simply the
    collection of all programs submitted to a compiler.  IBS involves a
    three-phase process of (1) identification of the subset of all programs in
    a protocol that represent the initial attempts at achieving programming
    goals, (2) bug identification, and (3) rubric-based scoring.  We conclude

    With the increasing use of hardware description languages, however, it has

    Hardware description languages let circuit specifications assume textual

    Increased interest in hardware compilation is largely due to the advent of

    research suggests that the BET approach can reveal faults in small systems
    with inputs of low structural complexity, but its potential utility for
    larger systems with more complex input structures remains unclear.  We set
    out to test its utility on one such system.  We used Alloy and TestEra to
    generate inputs to test the Galileo dynamic fault tree analysis tool, for
    which we already had both a formal specification of the input space and a
    test oracle.  An initial attempt to generate inputs using a straightforward
    translation of our specification to Alloy did not work well. The generator
    failed to generate inputs to meaningful bounds.  We developed an approach
    in which we factored the specification, used TestEra to generate abstract
    inputs based on one factor, and passed the results through a postprocessor
    that reincorporated information from the second factor.  Using this
    technique, we were able to generate test inputs to meaningful bounds, and
    the inputs revealed nontrivial faults in the Galileo implementation, our
    specification, and our oracle.  Our results suggest that BET, combined with

    an application's characteristics are the major influences on the choice of
    whether to choose COTS or custom. For stringent applications-those that
    demand high integrity, reliability, and availability- the cost of creating
    a suitable assurance or safety argument may be prohibitive, or even
    impossible if there is insufficient access to the COTS software's design
    rationale.  On the other hand, applications that emphasize flexibility may
    find that real-time kernels, which change relatively little and have seen
    extensive use, may be more robust than bespoke solutions.  Hard data that
    would clarify the trade-offs between custom versus COTS solutions is still
    not available.  McDermid states that more experience is needed to determine
    the relative costs of each solution.  The observations should be made of a
    long-term development cycle that includes multiple upgrades and maintenance
    problems.  Meanwhile, he states, the best strategies for those
    contemplating COTS use are to identify and plan for both project and
    COTS-specific risks and look beyond the initial development cost to the
    lifetime support of the product.  Those who fail to do so may end up paying
    more than the COTS solution is worth.",

    much agreement on the form that this support should take.  The result of
    this lack of agreement is that hardware mechanisms are often completely

    two somewhat unattractive choices: They can write software to fit many
    different architectures or they can insert layers of software to emulate a
    particular hardware interface.  In this article, the authors present the
    software mechanisms of virtual memory from a hardware perspective and then
    describe several hardware examples and how they support virtual-memory
    software.  Their focus is to show the diversity of virtual-memory support
    and, by implication, how this diversity complicates the design and porting

    of the domains (PSTN and Internet) unaware as to where the service is
    executing with respect to which domain actually requested the service.
    Individual entities participating in the service do not have any knowledge
    that external entities from another domain also contributed in the
    execution and fulfillment of such services.  Our approach, as embodied in

    and video over IP, in packet switched networks is based on dividing the
    stream into packets and shipping each of the packets on an individual basis
    to the destination through the network.  The basic implicit assumption on
    these applications is that shipping all the packets of an application is
    done, most of the time, over a single path along the network.  In this
    work, we present a model in which packets of a certain session are
    dispersed over multiple paths, in contrast to the traditional approach.
    The dispersion may be performed by network nodes for various reasons such
    as load-balancing, or implemented as a mechanism to improve quality, as
    will be presented in this work.  To study the effect of packet dispersion
    on the quality of voice over IP (VoIP) applications, we focus on the effect
    of the network loss on the applications, where we propose to use the
    Noticeable Loss Rate (NLR) as a measure (negatively) correlated with the
    voice quality.  We analyze the NLR for various packet dispersion strategies
    over paths experiencing memoryless (Bernoulli) or bursty (Gilbert model)
    losses, and compare them to each other.  Our analysis reveals that in many
    situations the use of packet dispersion reduces the NLR and thus improves
    session quality.  The results suggest that the use of packet dispersion can
    be quite beneficial for these applications.",

    that high-change modules had fairly high places in measurement rankings,

    important reason is that while at the functional level well-known
    modularization principles are applied for structuring functionality in
    modules, this is not the case at the build level for structuring files in
    directories.  This leads to a situation where files are entangled in
    directory hierarchies and build processes, making it hard to extract
    functionality and to make functionality suitable for reuse. Consequently,
    software may not come available for reuse at all, or only in rather large
    chunks of functionality, which may lead to extra software dependencies.  In
    this paper, we propose to improve this situation by applying
    component-based software engineering (CBSE) principles to the build level.
    We discuss how existing software systems break CBSE principles, we
    introduce the notion of build-level components, and we define rules for
    developing such components.  To make our techniques feasible, we define a
    reengineering process for semiautomatically transforming existing software
    systems into build-level components.  Our techniques are demonstrated in
    two case studies where we decouple the source tree of Graphviz into 46

    suffering from the lack of applications in spite of active research over a
    decade.  This problem can be solved to a certain extent by porting
    successful legacy Internet applications and protocols to the ad hoc network
    domain.  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is designed to provide the
    signaling support for multimedia applications such as Internet telephony,
    Instant Messaging, Presence etc.  SIP relies on the infrastructure of the
    Internet and an overlay of centralized SIP servers to enable the SIP
    endpoints discover each other and establish a session by exchanging SIP
    messages.  However, such an infrastructure is unavailable in ad hoc
    networks.  In this paper, we propose two approaches to solve this problem
    and enable SIP-based session setup in ad hoc networks (i) a loosely coupled
    approach, where the SIP endpoint discovery is decoupled from the routing
    procedure and (ii) a tightly coupled approach, which integrates the
    endpoint discovery with a fully distributed cluster based routing protocol
    that builds a virtual topology for efficient routing.  Simulation
    experiments show that the tightly coupled approach performs better for
    (relatively) static multihop wireless networks than the loosely coupled
    approach in terms of the latency in SIP session setup.  The loosely coupled
    approach, on the other hand, generally performs better in networks with
    random node mobility.  The tightly coupled approach, however, has lower
    control overhead in both the cases.",

    only 7 percent annually.  As a result, a contemporary superscalar 300-MHz
    DEC Alpha system with a 40-ns DRAM can perform at least 24 instructions in
    the time it takes to access its memory just once.  In a few years, if
    current trends continue, the number of instructions per access could
    increase to a thousand.  Fortunately, memory is bandwidth another matter.
    Wider buses, multiple banks, more pins, the integrated circuit properties
    of DRAMs (such as static-column mode and on-chip cache), and the newer
    Rambus and synchronous DRAM have all contributed to band-widths that have
    scaled better than latency.  A central problem for memory system designers

    particular class of computations.The scheme nicely complements traditional

    photorealistic images in real time.  Vision researchers now work from
    images backward just as far as necessary to create models that capture a
    scene without going to full geometric models.  Graphics researchers now
    work with hybrid geometry and image models. These models use images as

    time for image synthesis: The combined graphics and vision approaches have
    a hybrid vigor, much of which stems from sampled representations.  This use
    of captured scenes (enhanced by vision research) yields richer rendering
    and modeling methods (for graphics) than methods that synthesize everything
    from scratch.  Exploiting temporal and spatial coherence (similarities in
    images) via the use of layers and other techniques is boosting runtime

    to execute instructions, computer architects expect to improve performance.
    However, two difficult problems limit ILP: branch instructions, which

    retrieve data from memory.  In the absence of new programming languages
    that are explicitly parallel, the task of "exposing" ILP falls to the

    will play a pivotal role in using predication and control speculation to
    expose more ILP.  To illustrate predication and control speculation, this
    article presents two code fragments scheduled with actual IA-64
    instructions that are representative of general-purpose integer code, such
    as that found in computer-aided design and database applications.  A

    Our study reveals the intrinsic high computational difficulty of these

    important task in software maintenance and regression testing.  Black-box
    program outputs have been used to characterize program behaviors and they
    are compared over program versions in traditional regression testing.
    Program spectra have recently been proposed to characterize a program's
    behavior inside the black box.  Comparing program spectra of program
    versions offers insights into the internal behavioral differences between
    versions.  In this paper, we present a new class of program spectra, value
    spectra, that enriches the existing program spectra family.  We compare the
    value spectra of a program's old version and new version to detect internal
    behavioral deviations in the new version.  We use a deviation-propagation
    call tree to present the deviation details.  Based on the
    deviation-propagation call tree, we propose two heuristics to locate
    deviation roots, which are program locations that trigger the behavioral
    deviations.  We also use path spectra (previously proposed program spectra)
    to approximate the program states in value spectra.  We then similarly
    compare path spectra to detect behavioral deviations and locate deviation
    roots in the new version.  We have conducted an experiment on eight C
    programs to evaluate our spectra-comparison approach.  The results show
    that both value-spectra-comparison and path-spectra-comparison approaches
    can effectively expose program behavioral differences between program
    versions even when their program outputs are the same, and our
    value-spectra-comparison approach reports deviation roots with high

    describes a hierarchical supervisor, whose failure-detection mechanism
    explicitly addresses systems with nondeterministic specifications. The
    supervisor, a unit separate from the target system, observes the system's
    external inputs and outputs and reports any failures.  Its hierarchical
    structure results from splitting the task of identifying the behavioral
    alternative the target system chooses from the task of checking the details
    of system behavior.  This structure makes it possible to efficiently trade
    off detection accuracy and computational cost.  A key element is a model,
    derived from the target system's specification, that prunes behavioral
    alternatives. To evaluate their approach, the authors created a prototype
    supervisor and used it to supervise the execution of the control program of
    a small telephone exchange.  Results indicate that the hierarchical
    supervisor can significantly reduce the computational cost of considering
    the target system's behavioral alternatives.  However, although the
    supervisor's computational cost is significantly reduced, it is still
    higher than that for the target system.",

    has dropped significantly to the point where such a processor can be used
    in consumer products and other cost-sensitive systems.  As a result, more
    and more products have begun using DSP processors, fueling demand for
    faster, smaller, cheaper, more energy-efficient chips.  Although

    Compare a cryptographic algorithm to the lock on your front door.
    Improving the lock probably won't make your house more secure.  Burglars
    don't try every possible key (the equivalent of a brute-force attack); most
    aren't clever enough to pick the lock (the equivalent of a cryptographic
    attack).  No, burglars smash windows, kick in doors, disguise themselves as

    powerful when it is done right, but it is not a panacea. Building a secure
    cryptographic system is easy to do badly and very difficult to do well.

    the IP community realized that the security architecture proposed for IPv6
    could also be used for IPv4.  Consequently, it extended this charter to
    retrofitting the security protocols, or IPsec protocols, into IPv4
    implementations.  Many IPv4 software vendors have announced they will
    support the IPsec protocols in future releases.  This retrofitting is an
    important part of the working group's charter because IPv6 deployment is
    turning out to be slow.  This article overviews the proposed security
    architecture and the two main protocols - the IP Security Protocol and the
    Internet Key Management Protocol - describes the risks they address, and
    touches on some implementation requirements.",

    availability. Vendors engaged in retrofitting security must contend with
    the Web environment's peculiarities, which include statelessness, location
    irrelevance, code and user mobility, and stranger-to-stranger
    communication.  This article presents a survey of Web-specific security
    issues.  The focus is on security in the server and host environments,
    mobile code, data transport, and anonymity and privacy.  The server is the
    central system and the repository of information resources.  The server is
    thus the locus of threats, whereas the client is largely out of sight.  The
    authors conclude that, although the state of Web security is abysmal, the
    use of the Web for business will result in a more serious approach to
    security.  They suggest that public-key technology will be the skeleton on
    which Web security will hang.  A trust management paradigm for securing Web
    commerce will give way to a risk management paradigm, in proportion to the
    value of the transactions moving on the Web.",

    system, which functions as part of a compiler generator, rewrites the

    generated compiler that rewrites the parse tree during parsing so as to
    produce the tree of the original grammar. The compiler writer can then
    write the semantic attribution to fit his or her original grammar without
    any knowledge of the changes made.  The method is expected to be efficient
    in most cases, even in parsing systems that do not explicitly build the
    entire parse tree.  The method complements previous work in its

    and latency to users is the network interface (NI), which connects a
    network to the host computer that runs the network software.  An NI
    includes hardware that exposes an internal interface-such as device
    registers- to a host processor.  A key problem with most current NIs is
    that their internal interface is similar to that of a disk's interface.
    Because of such limitations, current NIs will not be adequate for use with
    newer, high-performance networks and host computers. High-performance local
    area networks have advanced so far that some view them as a new class of
    networks called system area networks (SANs).  Emerging SANs deliver
    bandwidths of 10 Gbps or more and latencies of tens of nanoseconds-two to
    four orders of magnitude better than that delivered by most current
    LANs. New hosts demand much higher performance.  If NIs do not adapt to
    these changes they will become a barrier to improving network performance.
    To solve this problem, future NIs should appear to their hosts more like
    memory than like disk interfaces.  The authors argue that treating NI
    accesses like memory accesses is justified by the importance of network
    performance to future computers.",

    Self-adjusting trees are most suited to skewed key-access distributions as
    the techniques attempt to place the most commonly accessed keys near the
    root of the tree.  Theoretical bounds on worst-case and amortized
    performance (i.e., performance over a sequence of operations) have been
    derived which compare well with those for optimal binary search trees.  In
    this paper, we compare the performance of three different techniques for
    self-adjusting trees with that of AVL and random binary search trees.
    Comparisons are made for various tree sizes, levels of key-access-frequency
    skewness and ratios of insertions and deletions to searches.  The results
    show that, because of the high cost of maintaining self-adjusting trees, in
    almost all cases the AVL tree outperforms all the self-adjusting trees and
    in may cases even a random binary search tree has better performance, in
    term of CPU time, than any of the self-adjusting trees. Self-adjusting
    trees seem to perform best in a highly dynamic environment, contrary to

    technology-"write once, run anywhere"-is the fact that Java programs run on
    the Java virtual machine, insulating them from any contact with the
    underlying hardware.  Consequently, Java programs must execute indirectly
    through a translation layer built into the Java virtual machine.
    Translation essentially converts Java virtual machine instructions (called
    byte-codes) into corresponding machine-specific binary instructions.
    Bytecode is a single image of a program that will execute identically (in
    principle) on any system equipped with a JVM.  The first step toward the
    development of a new class of Java processors was the creation of the
    bytecode execution engine itself, called the picoJava core.  PicoJava
    directly executes Java bytecode instructions and provides hardware support
    for other essential functions of the JVM.  Executing bytecode instructions
    in hardware eliminates the need for dynamic translation, thus extending the
    useful range of Java bytecode programs to embedded environments.  By the
    end of 1998, Java processors like Sun's microJava 701 should be available
    for evaluation from several licensees of the picoJava core technology},

    Therefore, they are archived onto an optical disk juke-box system.  A

    resulting records point to file names stored in the archive.  This allows

    growing discrepancy between processor and memory technologies will cause
    tightly integrated message interfaces to be essential for achieving the
    necessary efficiency, which is especially important in light of the growing
    interest in software-distributed, shared-memory systems.  In traditional
    message interfaces, high latency and processor occupancy inhibit the
    exploitation of large-scale parallelism.  Newer designs address this
    problem by removing OS layers from the interface, but the remaining
    overhead is still large.  To amortize this overhead, programmers use
    messages that are hundreds to thousands of words in size.  Consequently,
    threads run for thousands of cycles between communications, which precludes
    much parallelization.  When designers incorporate multiple hardware thread
    slots onto each node, this overhead is exacerbated if primitive support for
    fair and protected resource allocation is lacking.  Much of the
    communication overhead can be removed by carefully making complementary
    design choices in primitive messaging mechanisms in order to facilitate
    messages as short as several words in size and to enable fine-grain
    parallelism.  The authors conduct a performance evaluation of several
    primitive messaging mechanisms-dispatch mechanisms (how the processor
    reacts to message arrivals), memory-mapped versus register-mapped
    interfaces, and streaming versus buffered interfaces-baselining these
    results against the MIT M-Machine and its tightly integrated message
    interfaces.  They find that a message can be dispatched up to 18 times
    faster by reserving a hardware thread context for message reception instead
    of an interrupt- driven interface.  They also find that the mapping
    decision is important, with integrated register-mapped interfaces as much
    as 3.5 times more efficient than conventional systems.  To meet the
    challenges and exploit the opportunities presented by emerging
    multithreaded processor architectures, low overhead mechanisms for
    protection against message corruption, interception, and starvation must be
    integral to the message system design.  The authors hope that the simple
    messaging mechanisms described in this article can help provide a solution
    to these challenges.",

    can tailor the communication layers each process uses to the demands of

    cases, these protocols require that all network access be through the
    operating system, which adds significant overhead to both the transmission
    path (typically a system call and data copy) and the receive path
    (typically an interrupt, a system call, and a data copy).  To address this
    performance problem, several user-level communication architectures have
    been developed that remove the operating system from the critical
    communication path.  This article describes six important issues to
    consider in designing communication protocols for user-level architectures.
    The issues discussed focus on the performance and semantics of a
    communication system.  These issues include data transfer, address
    translation, protection, and control transfer mechanisms, as well as the
    issues of reliability and multicast.  To provide a basis for analyzing
    these issues, the authors present a simple network interface protocol for
    Myricom's Myrinet network, which has a programmable network
    interface. Researchers can thus explore many protocol design options, and
    several groups have designed communication systems for Myrinet.  In this
    article, the authors refer to 11 such systems, all of which differ

    The authors' work has focused on the technology's major drawback-its
    inefficiency in supporting high-bandwidth interfaces.  Their approach is to
    optimize packet processing by applying techniques that transfer packets
    directly among host interfaces, thus removing an extra data copy.  This
    technique increases data throughput by 45 percent while reducing the host's
    CPU load.  They found that peer-DMA forwarding can increase host-based
    router throughput by up to 45 percent, supporting bandwidths of 480 Mbps.
    Peer-DMA host-based forwarding requires network interface cards with
    substantial shared-memory resources, because packet queues are stored on
    the interfaces themselves, rather than in host RAM. The queuing algorithm
    remains in the host CPU, supporting advanced queue management.  Current
    systems have limited packet processing.  A combination of stream-lined
    forwarding algorithms and aggregate interrupt processing should further
    increase host-based capability.  Moving some of the IP processing out to
    the NIC coprocessor may enable this.  It is also apparent that as processor
    speeds increase, the advantages of peer-DMA will aid throughput for small

    Java's object-oriented nature is ideally suited to this new world.  Using

    and with other agents. The key concepts in this definition are
    interoperability and autonomy.  These concepts set agents apart from
    conventional objects, which always fulfill any methods invoked on them.
    Agents, in contrast, should be able to refuse an action.  Thus, agents must
    be able to talk to each other to decide what information to retrieve or
    what physical action to take, such as shutting down an assembly line.  The
    mechanism for this exchange is the agent communication language (ACL).
    Theoretically, an ACL should let heterogeneous agents communicate.  None
    currently do: Although ACLs are being used in proprietary multiagent
    applications, nonproprietary agents cannot interoperate.  The author agrees
    with those who lay the fault for this on the lack of a formal
    semantics. However, he is not convinced that the existing work on ACL
    semantics is heading in the right direction.  Current work, he argues, is
    repeating the past mistake of emphasizing mental agency-the supposition
    that agents should be understood primarily in terms of mental concepts,
    such as beliefs and intentions.  This approach supposes, in essence, that
    agents can read each other's minds.  This supposition has never held for
    people, and for the same reason, it will not hold for agents.  In this
    article, the author explains why an ACL's formal semantics should emphasize
    social agency.  This approach recognizes that communication is inherently
    public, and thus depends on the agent's social context.",

    processes. Conventional techniques for implementing concurrent objects
    typically rely on critical sections; ensuring that only one process at a
    time can operate on the object.  Nevertheless, critical sections are poorly
    suited for asynchronous systems: if one process is halted or delayed in a
    critical section, other, nonfaulty processes will be unable to progress.
    By contrast, a concurrent object implementation is lock free if it always
    guarantees that some process will complete an operation in a finite number
    of steps, and it is wait free if it guarantees that each process will
    complete an operation in a finite number of steps.  This paper proposes a
    new methodology for constructing lock-free and wait-free implementations of
    concurrent objects.  The object's representation and operations are written
    as stylized sequential programs, with no explicit synchronization.  Each
    sequential operation is atutomatically transformed into a lock-free or
    wait-free operation using novel synchronization and memory management
    algorithms.  These algorithms are presented for a multiple instruction/
    multiple data (MIMD) architecture in which n processes communicate by
    applying atomic read, write, load_linked, and store_conditional operations

    major downsides is information overload.  Indeed, the amount of information
    easily pushes the limit of what people can manage.  This conflict drives
    research to seek a solution to humanity's information woes.  As computers
    have shrunk from room size to palm size, so they have also moved from being
    passive accessories, such as laptops and personal digital assistants, to
    wearable appliances that form an integral part of our personal space.
    Wearable computers are always on and accessible.  As the computer moves
    from desktop to coat pocket to the human body, its ability to help manage,
    sort, and filter information will become more intimately connected to our
    daily lives.  In the next five years, expect to see wearable computing
    technology embedded in application-specific portable devices such as
    digital music players and cellular phones.  By the next decade, you may
    have a device that gives continuous access to computing and communications
    resources on a machine intelligent enough to know what you're interested
    in, when to give it to you, and how to present it in the most appropriate
    manner. Artificial intelligence will augment human intelligence to make
    information management as natural as any other physiological function,
    freeing the human intellect to focus on creative rather than computational
    functions.",

    evident than in the phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web.  In another
    sense, though, computer networking is being pulled in two opposite
    directions.  On the one hand, the Web's popularity and growth has been
    fueled largely by desk-top applications consuming bandwidth-intensive
    images and video.  On the other hand, thin-client computers are becoming
    more commonly used as edge-of-network devices, often connected by wireless
    technology.  There is also an increasing mismatch between fiber-optic
    transmission bandwidths and computer speeds, pushing computing further away
    from the network core.  Are there ways to close, or at least manage, this
    growing schism-whether through novel hardware solutions or the
    programmability of network infrastructures? Can we better integrate these
    edge-of- network devices and make them full-fledged network participants?
    High-speed optical networks mix many types of traffic and services, so only
    features needed by all aggregated services will be cost-effective to place
    there.  They are unlikely to employ software and computing except in the
    so-called control plane, which manipulates the behavior of the transport
    system.  Low-cost and low-powered thin clients need networks and software
    that allow plug and play and unplug: secure, mobile, sporadically detached
    operation.  Introducing programmability into the network infrastructure (or
    exposing preexisting programmability to users) could meet these needs, and
    active networks are one model for programming net-works.  Although what
    technologies will prevail is in question, networking and computing will
    continue to converge.  Currently, this convergence is resulting in
    increased collaboration between the network infrastructure and the end
    hosts to meet application needs.",

    game artificial intelligence, for which fast response times and a
    full-featured programming environment are critical.  The Cell Broadband
    Engine architecture targets such applications, providing both
    flexibility and high performance by utilizing a 64-bit multithreaded
    PowerPC  processor element (PPE) with two levels of globally coherent
    cache and eight synergistic processor elements (SPEs), each consisting of a
    processor designed for streaming workloads, a local memory, and a globally
    coherent DMA (direct memory access) engine.  Growth in processor complexity
    is driving a parallel need for sophisticated compiler technology. In this
    paper, we present a variety of compiler techniques designed to exploit the
    performance potential of the SPEs and to enable the multilevel
    heterogeneous parallelism found in the Cell Broadband Engine architecture.
    Our goal in developing this compiler has been to enhance programmability
    while continuing to provide high performance.  We review the Cell Broadband
    Engine architecture and present the results of our compiler techniques,
    including SPE optimization, automatic code generation, single source
    parallelization, and partitioning.",

    commonly consists of 350--750 axial images of 512x512 sub-millimeter

    lumen.  A 3D model of the colon is then reconstructed from the CT scan by
    automatically segmenting the colon out of the rest of the abdomen and
    employing an electronic cleansing algorithm for computer-based removal of
    the residual material.  The PC-based visualization software employs volume
    rendering and allows the user, typically a physician, to interactively
    navigate through the virtual 3D model of the colon.  An intuitive user
    interface with customized tools supports measurements and virtual biopsy to
    inspect suspicious regions.  Unlike optical colonoscopy (see the sidebar

  abstract     = "Decision support systems (DSSs) are software products that
    help users apply analytical and scientific methods to decision making.
    They work by using models and algorithms from disciplines such as decision
    analysis, mathematical programming and optimization, stochastic modeling,
    simulation, and logic modeling.  DSS products can execute, interpret,
    visualize, and interactively analyze these models over multiple scenarios.
    In recent years, the growing popularity of online analytical processing,
    data warehousing and supply chain management has led to an increased
    interest in the development of decision support systems.  When well
    implemented and used wisely, DSSs can significantly improve the quality of
    an organization's decision making.  However, building a DSS requires
    significant expertise in decision analysis, programming, and user interface
    design.  A DSS can also need to connect in real time with other enterprise
    applications, further complicating the task.  For these reasons, the broad
    use of DSSs-- compared with, say, database-management systems-- has not
    occurred.  What's missing is sophisticated tool support for developing
    DSSs. One current solution is a DSS generator, a kit or environment for
    developing an application-specific DSS.  DSS generators are crucial to the
    success of DSSs in practice.  In this article, the authors describe the
    state of the art in DSS generator software, specifically in the realm of
    decision analysis methods. They briefly describe the features of 11
    commercially available DSS generators that specialize in decision
    analysis.",

    programming inherited from their common ancestorthe von Neumann
    computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their
    division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of
    statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for
    building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful
    mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.  An alternative
    functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms
    for creating programs.  Functional programs deal with structured data, are
    often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do
    not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of
    procedure declarations to become generally applicable.  Combining forms can
    use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not
    possible in conventional languages.  Associated with the functional style
    of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
    programs and whose operations are combining forms.  This algebra can be
    used to transform programs and to solve equations whose unknowns
    are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school
    algebra.  These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried
    out in the same language in which programs are written.  Combining forms
    are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of
    their associated algebraic laws.  General theorems of the algebra give the
    detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.
    A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both
    in its programming language and in its state transition rules.  Unlike von
    Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to
    statesonly one state transition occurs per major computation.",

    problem of producing aesthetically pleasing drawings of trees, see Reingold
    and Tilford (1981), Wetherell and Shannon (1979) but implementations only
    exist as "special purpose software", designed for special environments.
    Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most
    personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look
    "hand-drawn"; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding
    text that can be realized by today's high quality text processing systems.
    In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree
    drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available.
    More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a
    drawing of a tree from a purely logical description.  Our approach has
    three advantages.  First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable
    way.  On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of
    the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on
    the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated
    uniformly.  Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running
    TeX.  Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX's macro
    capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes.  In
    addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make
    the structure of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they
    may not be as aesthetically pleasing.},

    primarily on prevention: putting controls and mechanisms in place that
    protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability by stopping users from
    doing bad things.  Moreover, most mechanisms are powerless against
    misbehavior by legitimate users who perform functions for which they are
    authorized: the so-called "insider threat." Many network-based attacks,
    such as password sniffing and session hijacking, allow an attacker to
    masquerade as a legitimate user.  Although, ultimately, preventing
    malicious attacks from succeeding is key, not all attacks can be averted at
    the outset.  The goal therefore should be to develop an adaptable system
    that maintains maximum availability even when under attack: At any time,
    healthy components of the system remain available while damaged components
    have either limited or no availability.},

    ideas: Internet Protocol version 6, Mobile IP, IP Multicast, and
    Integrated/ Differentiated Services aim to support multimedia applications
    more effectively and to accommodate more hosts, many of them mobile.
    Unfortunately, progress in implementing these solutions lags far behind the
    identified need.  The main problem is the way network protocols must
    change.  First, network protocols are the main vehicle for achieving
    interoperability, so any candidate internetworking protocol has to become a
    standard.  This means possibly years between the time someone identifies a
    need and the time everyone agrees on how to address it.  Once the new
    protocol has been accepted, more delays occur because it has to be deployed
    manually and in a way that is compatible with the existing protocols.
    ANTS, a new approach to deploying network services, bases interoperability
    on a programmable network model, not on individual networking protocols.
    The promise is automatic protocol upgrades, which can hasten progress

    (so-called CASE tools), which can support good-quality documentation,
    simple forms of consistency checking and bookkeeping, VLP also supports
    executable specifications, which provide a prototype of the desired
    application.  After reviewing the principles of VLP, the paper outlines the
    structure of the ECASET environment in which VLP is embedded.  In
    particular, it shows how the environment supports the stepwise derivation
    of specifications, from informal to formal, and how it supports
    specification-in-the-large.",

    significant and growing.  Contemporary 3D digitization technologies allow

    high-resolution digital archive of 10 of Michelangelo's large statues,
    including the David (see the sidebar "Generating a Replica of
    Michelangelo's David").  These statues represent the artistic patrimony of
    Italy's cultural institutions, and our contract with the Italian
    authorities permits distribution of the 3D models only to established
    scholars for noncommercial use.  Though everyone involved would like the
    models to be available for any constructive purpose, the digital 3D model
    of the David would quickly be pirated if it were distributed without
    protection; simulated marble replicas would be manufactured outside the
    provisions of the parties authorizing creation of the model.},

    algorithms use a static model of the clusters and do not use information
    about the nature of individual clusters as they are merged.  Furthermore,
    one set of schemes (the CURE algorithm and related schemes) ignores the
    information about the aggregate interconnectivity of items in two clusters.
    Another set of schemes (the Rock algorithm, group averaging method, and
    related schemes) ignores information about the closeness of two clusters as
    defined by the similarity of the closest items across two clusters.  By
    considering either interconnectivity or closeness only, these algorithms
    can select and merge the wrong pair of clusters.  Chameleon's key feature
    is that it accounts for both interconnectivity and closeness in identifying
    the most similar pair of clusters.  Chameleon finds the clusters in the
    data set by using a two-phase algorithm.  During the first phase, Chameleon
    uses a graph-partitioning algorithm to cluster the data items into several

    to facilitate the application of feedback scheduling.  An event-driven
    paradigm that combines time-triggered and event-triggered approaches is
    proposed for programming of the feedback scheduler.  Simulation results
    argue that the proposed event-driven paradigm yields better performance
    than time-triggered paradigm in dynamic environments where the workload
    varies irregularly and unpredictably.",

    compartments surrounded by porous membranes, which contain data that are
    transformed by transformation rules.  P systems can be simulated by a
    distributed computing system, where each compartment of a given system is
    simulated by a (remote) process, each running on a different node.  By
    adopting a more "liberal" membrane structure where compartments do not
    necessarily form a tree-structure but a graph-structure, we get a more
    general model of computation, which we call graph structured P systems.
    Any instance of the new model can be implemented by a network of virtual
    machines, called &Pgr; machines, where each machine is able to implement
    the functionality of any simple compartment.},

    semantics and are used for modeling and designing embedded software and
    hardware.  Actors interact with one another through ports via a messaging
    schema that can follow any of several concurrent semantics.
    Domain-specific actor-oriented languages and frameworks are common
    (Simulink, LabVIEW, SystemC, etc.).  However, they lack many modularity and
    abstraction mechanisms that programmers have become accustomed to in
    object-oriented components, such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and
    polymorphism, except as inherited from the host language.  This article
    shows a form that such mechanisms can take in actor-oriented components,
    gives a formal structure, and describes a prototype implementation. The
    mechanisms support actor-oriented class definitions, subclassing,
    inheritance, and overriding.  The formal structure imposes structural
    constraints on a model (mainly the "derivation invariant") that lead to a
    policy to govern inheritance.  In particular, the structural constraints
    permit a disciplined form of multiple inheritance with unambiguous
    inheritance and overriding behavior.  The policy is based formally on a
    generalized ultrametric space with some remarkable properties.  In this
    space, inheritance is favored when actors are "closer" (in the generalized
    ultrametric), and we show that when inheritance can occur from multiple
    sources, one source is always unambiguously closer than the other.},

    Habermas to theorize a place for religion in the public sphere" after
    leaving it almost completely out of his pathbreaking study, The Structural
    Transformation of the Public Sphere. Calhoun discusses the use of
    public/private distinctions to privilege secularism, ways in which religion
    has been constitutive of meaning and social practices historically, and
    whether attempts to disengage religion from public reason give undue
    advantage to "a secular middle class in Europe, a secular 'native' majority
    in Europe, and a relatively secular white elite in the U.S. in relation to
    more religious Blacks, Latinos, and immigrant populations." Calhoun argues
    that rethinking secularism does not mean abandoning norms of fairness or
    state neutrality among religions.  But rethinking secularism does matter
    academically and in terms of practical fairness, he contends, at a time
    when "globalization, migration, economic stresses, and insecurity all make
    strengthening commitments to citizenship and participation in shared public
    discourse vital."},

    recent years, but  many of these promising ideas have failed to enter into

    barriers to new  development.  For example, file systems today typically
    stand alone instead of  building on the work of others, and support of new
    filing services often  requires changes that invalidate existing work.
    Stackable file-system design  addresses these issues in several ways.
    Complex filing services are  constructed from layer “building blocks,” each
    of which may be provided by  independent parties.  There are no syntactic
    constraints to layer order, and  layers can occupy different address
    spaces, allowing very flexible layer  configuration.  Independent layer
    evolution and development are supported by  an extensible interface
    bounding each layer.  This paper discusses stackable  layering in detail
    and presents design techniques it enables.  We describe an  implementation
    providing these facilities that exhibits very high performance.  By
    lowering barriers to new filing design, stackable layering offers the
    potential of broad third-party file-system development not feasible

    sometimes stretching over several months for complex designs.  In the past
    two decades, various test development automation tools have attempted to
    address this problem and reduce the bottleneck in the product's time to
    market.  These tools, which automate dozens of tasks essential for
    developing adequate tests, generally fall into four categories: design for
    testability (DFT), test pattern generation, pattern-grading, and test
    program development and debugging.  The focus in this article is on
    automatic test-pattern- generation tools.  Researchers have looked
    primarily at issues such as scalability, ability to handle various fault
    models, and how to extend the algorithms beyond Boolean domains to handle
    different abstraction levels.  Their aims were to speed up test generation,
    reduce test sequence length, and minimize power consumption.  As design
    trends move toward nanometer technology, however, new ATPG problems are
    emerging. Current modeling and vector generation techniques must give way
    to new techniques that consider timing information during test generation,
    scale to larger designs, and can capture extreme design conditions.  The
    authors describe current ATPG techniques and efforts to adapt ATPG
    technology to handle deep-submicron faults and to identify design errors
    and timing problems during design verification.",

     gigahertz.  With all this progress on the design front, it's easy to
     overlook a simple fact: More complex designs also pose problems for
     manufacturing and test.  The challenges are especially acute in test.
     Test costs traditionally rise as frequency, transistors, and pin counts
     increase.  Without substantial changes in test technology, the
     billion-transistor ICs projected within the next 12 years could cost many
     times more to test than the 40-million-transistor microprocessors of
     today.  Test costs today are already high.  Large testers can cost up to
     $6 million, as each pin costs between $5,000 and $10,000.  Current IC pin
     counts are in the hundreds.  Nanometer designs are anticipated to have pin
     counts in the thousands.  Manufacturers will continue to pay these high
     test equipment costs for some time because the cost of changing systems is
     even more staggering. Why are these costs so high and how are they
     affected by nanometer technologies? The authors answer these questions by
     looking to the defects that occur in semiconductor manufacturing.  In
     looking at the future, the test community sees staggering challenges based

    them include a wide range of variables.  These defects can take a variety
    of forms, from localized spot defects-typically extra or missing material
    caused by particles-to defects affecting much larger areas, such as reduced
    capacitance caused by inadequate implantation.  To simplify the
    identification of defective circuits, this infinite defect space is
    approximated by a finite set of faults.  Faults are deterministic, discrete
    changes in circuit behavior.  They are often considered localized within a
    circuit (for example, when a particular gate is broken) and can also be
    thought of as transformations that change the Boolean function implemented
    by a circuit.  Research into fault models has generated new methods for
    extending them from the gate level to the presynthesized
    register-transfer-level (RTL) and behavioral code.  Chip designers can use
    simple models-such as stuck-at faults-to find a wide variety of defects.

    by the significant timing-closure problems that are arising in current
    high-performance IC designs.  Based on this, both industry and academia
    sense the need for a significant over-haul of current synthesis and
    physical-design methodologies. In the emerging design scenario, traditional
    design flows will no longer be viable for any size of module or block of
    gates.  Deep-submicron effects-particularly those relating to
    interconnects-have thus been billed as potential roadblocks to the
    continuation of Moore's law.  Some effects, like the rising
    resistance-capacitance (RC) delay of on-chip wiring, noise considerations,
    reliability concerns, and increased power dissipation, manifest themselves
    in both the devices (transistors) and the interconnect, though not in ways
    previously anticipated.  The authors consider the effects of both devices
    and interconnect.  Their analysis shows that interconnect delay actually
    decreases for DSM processes in a modular design approach.  The physical

    established.  This is followed by a brief description of the two basic
    approaches to communications security, link-oriented measures and

    discrete mathematics through examples focused on reasoning about software
    and (2) those who studied the same mathematical topics illustrated with
    more traditional examples.  Functional programming played a central role in
    the study because it provides a straightforward framework for the
    presentation of concepts such as predicate logic and proof by induction.
    Such topics can be covered in depth, staying almost entirely within the
    context of reasoning about software.  The intricate complexities in logic
    that mutable variables carry with them need not arise, early on, to confuse
    novices struggling to understand new ideas.  In addition, because
    functional languages provide useful and compact ways to express
    mathematical concepts, and because the choice of notation in mathematics
    courses is often at the discretion of the instructor (in contrast to the
    notational restrictions often fiercely guarded by the faculty in
    programming courses), discrete mathematics courses, as they are found in
    most computer science programs, provide an easy opportunity to enhance the
    education of students by exposing them to functional programming
    concepts.",

    economists were forecasting a crisis of leisure that would arise because of
    society's increased time savings from technology.  As anyone who totes a
    laptop, cell phone, and pager can attest, technology seems to have
    overcomplicated life rather than uncomplicated it.  Something has gone
    terribly awry in the way people and computers relate.  If scientists like
    MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld have their way, however, the new millennium
    could bring a new order.  Computers and information technology could come
    full circle, seeming to fade into the background--becoming almost
    transparent--even as they become all the more pervasive, useful, and
    powerful.  The author examines Gershenfeld's research into how computers
    could change radically in the next millennium and what it will take to
    design them.  The article covers possible future applications and
    limitations, the primary obstacle being the cost of chip
    production. Significant cost reduction is needed in chip production before
    revolutionary changes in applications can occur.",

    top-down approach—essentially forcing groups to become suppliers on the
    internal software market—won't work.  For groups to switch from being
    consumers to being suppliers, they must have incentives and find the
    prospect attractive.  Philips Healthcare has been working toward an
    internal open-source market for more than five years.  In this article, the
    author describes the company's evolving process along with lessons learned
    about market mechanisms and business models for the internal software
    market.  The key question guiding their efforts is how to turn software
    consumers into active producers of the platform assets.",

    result is a highly flexible mechanism for growing new language constructs

    In the early days, developing CE software presented relatively minor
    challenges, but in the past several years three significant problems have
    arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the
    increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for
    decreased development time.The question of handling diversity and
    complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes
    an urgent one.  The authors present their belief that the answer lies not
    in hiring more software engineers.  They are not readily available, and
    even if they were, experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead
    times and often result in greater complexity.  Instead, they believe that
    the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work
    within an explicit software architecture.The Koala model, a
    component-oriented approach detailed in this article, is their way of
    handling the diversity of software in consumer electronics.  Used for
    embedded software in TV sets, it allows late binding of reusable components

    not impersonal technology, but rather a part of an intellectual patent
    system that is a social artifact.  Because all social artifacts are fair

    ethics and morality of any branch of the legal system (of which software
    patents and copyrights are a part), but he feels professionals in relevant

    patents for other more practical and just forms of monopoly for software.",

    Users want to keep running their favorite applications as they normally

    legacy applications the problem is more severe.  Without all the source
    code, it is well-nigh impossible to recompile the application to a new
    platform.Binary translation helps this transition process because it
    automatically converts the binary code from one instruction set to another
    without the need for high-level source code.  However, different choices
    force different trade-offs between some form of interpretation (or
    emulation) and static translation.  Interpretation requires no user
    intervention, but its performance is slow.  Static translation, on the
    other hand, requires user intervention but provides much better
    performance.To help PA-RISC (precision architecture-reduced instruction set

    The Binary-translation Optimized Architecture (BOA), an implementation of

    optimization.  The authors use these techniques to simplify the hardware by
    bridging a semantic gap between the PowerPC's reduced instruction set and
    even simpler hardware primitives.Processors like the Pentium Pro and Power4
    have tried to achieve high frequency and ILP by implementing a cracking
    scheme in hardware: An instruction decoder in the pipeline generates
    multiple micro-operations that can then be scheduled out of order.  BOA
    relies on an alternative software approach to decompose complex operations
    and to generate schedules, and thus offers significant advantages over
    purely static compilation approaches.  This article explains BOA's
    translation strategy, detailing system issues and architecture

    in their infancy compared to their compiler counterparts, engineers have
    been using them for 15 years.  Just as engineers build compilers partly on

    Queensland Binary Translator (UQBT) on the basis of machine specifications
    and properties of machines and operating systems.  This static

    to be mature and how SE was doing.  Their study found that, relative to

    education and training programs.  But despite all this progress, SE, while
    recognizable, is still immature-- as evidenced by the significant gap among
    vision, education, and standard practice.  The reasons are legion, but they
    boil down to one simple fact: The field is still young.The authors present
    their assessment of SE immaturity in this article.  Although they believe
    time will eventually mature SE, a calculated push can accelerate the

    Playing design diagrams is particularly important while exploring
    alternative solutions during the early stages of designing all kinds of
    systems.  It is done either by mentally tracing sequences across diagrams
    on paper or a computer screen, or physically tracing them on whiteboards
    with a pointer or finger during design meetings.  Two complementary
    pictorial design notations are described and used together in an example to
    illustrate the concept of play and to show how to do it: timethreads, a new
    notation for causality sequences that cut across many components and across
    the system end-to-end, and machine charts, an older notation for
    architecture presented here from a new angle.  These notations are
    specifically designed to support play during the design process, not just

    this situation is particularly obvious because the domain's requirements

    a generic object-oriented framework has been proposed for modeling both
    physical and logical resources.  Although the framework is generic, it is
    mainly used with the industry-standard unified modeling language (UML).  By
    providing a standard means for representing resources and their attributes,
    it becomes possible to seamlessly transfer UML models of real-time systems

    domain-specific languages, offer significant advantages to their users,
    such as high-level declarative constructs and domain-specific analyses.
    Despite these advantages, attribute grammars are often not adopted to the
    degree that their proponents envision.  One practical obstacle to their
    adoption is a perceived lack of both domain-specific and general purpose
    language features needed to address the many different aspects of a
    problem.  Here we describe Silver, an extensible attribute grammar
    specification system, and show how it can be extended with general purpose
    features such as pattern matching and domain-specific features such as
    collection attributes and constructs for supporting data-flow analysis of
    imperative programs.  The result is an attribute grammar specification
    language with a rich set of language features.  Silver is implemented in
    itself by a Silver attribute grammar and utilizes forwarding to implement
    the extensions in a cost-effective manner.",

    language-level replacement for locks, there is growing need for
    well-defined semantics.  In contrast to database transactions, transaction
    memory (TM) semantics are complicated by the fact that programs may access
    the same memory locations both inside and outside transactions.  Strongly
    atomic semantics, where non-transactional accesses are treated as implicit
    single-operation transactions, remain difficult to provide without
    specialized hardware support and/or significant performance overhead.  As
    an alternative, many in the community have informally proposed that a
    single global lock semantics [16, 9], where transaction semantics are
    mapped to those of regions protected by a single global lock, provide an
    intuitive and efficiently implementable model for programmers.  In this
    paper, we explore the implementation and performance implications of single
    global lock semantics in a weakly atomic STM from the perspective of Java,
    and we discuss why even recent STM implementations fall short of these
    semantics.  We describe a new weakly atomic Java STM implementation that
    provides single global lock semantics while permitting concurrent
    execution, but we show that this comes at a significant performance cost.
    We also propose and implement various alternative semantics that loosen
    single lock requirements while still providing strong guarantees.  We
    compare our new implementations to previous ones, including a strongly
    atomic STM.  [22]",

    As it runs, a program overwrites its previous state, which might have
    provided a clue as to how the program got to the point at which it computed
    the wrong answer or otherwise failed.  This all-too-common experience is
    symptomatic of a more general problem: the difficulty of accurately and
    efficiently capturing and analyzing the sequence of events that occur when
    a program executes.  Program paths offer an insight into a program's
    dynamic behavior that is difficult to achieve any other way.  Unlike
    simpler measures such as program profiles, which aggregate information to
    reduce the cost of collecting or storing data, paths capture some of the
    usually invisible dynamic sequencing of statements.  This work exploits the
    insight that program statements do not execute in isolation, but are
    typically correlated with the behavior of previously executed code.",

    2007.  The results suggest that the software crisis is perhaps exaggerated

    failure rate, including cancelled and completed but poorly performing

    Migrating systems to a shared network infrastructure, however, frequently

    requires devising a way to isolate applications from one another in shared

    resources of end users, drawing upon proven tech-niques such as the methods
    that made Linux the most popular and reliable of all Unix flavors.  Totally

    the dynamics of social systems are driven by the behavior of individuals
    that make up those systems.  However, this process is hindered by the
    difficulty of experimentally studying how individual behavioral tendencies
    lead to collective social dynamics in large groups of people interacting
    over time.  In this study, we investigate the role of social influence, a
    process well studied at the individual level, on the puzzling nature of
    success for cultural products such as books, movies, and music.  Using a
    multiple-worlds experimental design, we are able to isolate the causal
    effect of an individual-level mechanism on collective social outcomes.  We
    employ this design in a Web-based experiment in which 2,930 participants
    listened to, rated, and downloaded 48 songs by up-and-coming bands.
    Surprisingly, despite relatively large differences in the demographics,
    behavior, and preferences of participants, the experimental results at both
    the individual and collective levels were similar to those found in
    Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006).  Further, by comparing results from two
    distinct pools of participants, we are able to gain new insights into the
    role of individual behavior on collective outcomes.  We conclude with a
    discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of Web-based experiments to
    address questions of collective social dynamics.",

    can choose precisely the tools and services their application requires.  On
    the other hand, finding the right products to use can be difficult.  The
    author explains that despite their differences, embedded systems share
    important characteristics with the desktop and server systems they
    supplant.  Because embedded systems interact with users or their
    environment, they need an I/O system.  Many embedded systems perform
    multiple tasks and also need an operating system for scheduling and task

    seamless, but also semantically valid.  Our chief insight is that while the

    differentiable scenes is actually not that large.  For many image
    completion tasks, we are able to find similar scenes which contain image
    fragments that will convincingly complete the image.  Our algorithm is
    entirely data driven, requiring no annotations or labeling by the user.
    Unlike existing image completion methods, our algorithm can generate a
    diverse set of image completions and we allow users to select among them.

    fact, Nokia's 9001 Communicator already combines the phone, pager, and
    diary into one unit.  The question arises, however, of how to provide user
    authentication.  Traditional protection mechanisms require users to enter a
    PIN or password every time they wish to perform a transaction.  More
    sophisticated techniques include using a biometric device, such as a
    fingerprint scanner, which is integrated into the e-wallet.  Both of these
    options have disadvantages.  Usability problems due to authentication are a
    significant barrier to the adoption of e-wallets.  In this article, the
    authors present some uses of existing protocols whereby a concealable,
    wireless, and portable device can temporarily act as an authentication
    proxy for the user.  The e-wallet then becomes a parasite-feeding off the
    small device for required authentication and identification information.

    hacking.  Minimizing program faults in business operations is critical for

    lead to subtle mistakes and even catastrophic failures.  The authors use an
    online ticket sales example to illustrate the potential of model checking
    (an advanced formal method) for economically finding certain flaws.  Model
    checking is a powerful verification method that determines whether a system
    model satisfies certain specifications under all circumstances.  It can

    first of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation [P] for the
    function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise.
    This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions
    and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals.  The second notation puts
    Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients.  Since
    binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read n
    choose k, Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines
    in brackets and read n cycle k, while Stirling numbers of the second kind
    should be written in braces and read n subset k.  (I might say n partition
    k.) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx.  The virtues of
    this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in
    combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations
    similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.",

    hundreds of millions of sites to search through, and 73 percent of the Web
    devoted to images, finding the exact image needed can be a daunting

    represent actual text in less space.  This process involves replacing text

    compression is attractive because it is cost efficient, requires less

    or more information sources--has become an integral part of everyday life.
    People keep abreast of world affairs by listening to news bites.  They base
    investment decisions on stock market updates.  They go to movies largely on
    the basis of reviews.  With summaries, they can make effective decisions in
    less time.Although summarizing tools are available, with the increasing
    volume of online information, it is becoming harder to generate meaningful
    and timely summaries.  Researchers are investigating tools and methods that
    automatically extract or abstract content from information sources.The
    authors describe how these data summarization methods fall into two
    categories.  Knowledge-poor approaches rely on not having to add new rules
    for each new application domain or language.  Knowledge-rich approaches
    assume that if you grasp the meaning of the text, you can reduce it more
    effectively, thus yielding a better summary.  They rely on a sizeable
    knowledge base of rules, which must be acquired, maintained, and then
    adapted to new applications and languages.The authors predict that
    summarization tools will be key in conquering the vast information
    universes ahead.",

    Software reliability theory is one of industry's seminal approaches for
    predicting the likelihood of software field failures.Software reliability
    theory seems to work accurately in telecommunications and aerospace.
    Governments regulate product quality in these two fields, whereas in other
    disciplines, quality has historically been an add-on, of lesser market
    value than feature richness or short release cycles.  Today, accurate
    quality measurement cannot be confined to particular industries; it is
    especially needed in shrink-wrap software.The authors' goal is to create a
    dialogue in the reliability community and to identify a technology base
    that will widen interest in software reliability among practitioners
    outside the telecom and aero-space domains.  They propose a new method for
    software reliability research.  They challenge the software reliability

    often used as a full blown programming language.  Although UML is headed in

    examination of the paradigm in the wide area context, leading to the
    second-generation effort, CapNet.  Without the support of some features
    inherent in local area networks, CapNet is faced with a new set of
    problems.  The issues involved, namely address space structure, page
    location, and caching algorithms, are discussed.  A new approach that
    combines the address translation and routing is suggested as an optimized
    page location solution.  A number of caching schemes are investigated, and

    paper we argue that current MIL/IDLs based on definition/use have some
    serious drawbacks.  A significant problem is that they fail to distinguish
    between implementation and interaction relationships between modules.  We
    propose an alternative model in which components interact along well 
    defined lines of communication -- or connectors.  Connectors are defined as
    protocols that capture the expected patterns of communication between
    modules.  We show how this leads to a scheme that is much more expressive
    for architectural relationships, that allows the formal definition of
    module interaction, and that supports its own form of automated checks and
    formal reasoning.",

    of the dynamic slice consisting of all statements that actually affect the
    value of a variable occurrence for a given program input.  The sensitivity
    of dynamic slicing to particular program inputs makes it more useful in
    program debugging and testing than static slicing.  Several approaches for
    computing dynamic slices are examined.  The notion of a Dynamic Dependence
    Graph and its use in computing dynamic slices is discussed.  The Dynamic
    Dependence Graph may be unbounded in length; therefore, we introduce the
    economical concept of a Reduced Dynamic Dependence Graph, which is
    proportional in size to the number of dynamic slices arising during the
    program execution.",

		  execution. Like a spreadsheet, a program is visible and
		  alive, constantly executing even as it is edited. Program
		  edits are coherent semantic transformations.
		  The essence of this new medium is copying. Programs are
		  constructed by copying and executed by copy flow: the
		  projection of changes through copies. The simple idea of
		  copying develops into a rich theory of higher-order continual

		  explicit relationships. Subtext unifies traditionally
		  distinct programming tools and concepts, and enables some
		  novel ones. Ancestral structures are a new primitive data
		  type that combines the features of lists and records, along
		  with unproblematic multiple inheritance. Adaptive
		  conditionals use first-class program edits to dynamically
		  adapt behavior.
		  A prototype implementation shows promise, but calls for much

		  class or one of its superclasses provides the corresponding
		  method to be executed. We have built an experimental Personal
		  Information Environment (PIE) in Smalltalk that extends this

		  have multiple perspectives, each of which provides
		  independent specialized behaviors for the object as a whole,
		  thus providing multiple inheritance for nodes. Nodes have
		  metadescription to guide viewing of the objects during
		  browsing, provide default values, constrain the values of
		  attributes, and define procedures to be run when values are
		  sought or set. All nodes have unique names which allow
		  objects to migrate between users and machines. Finally
		  attribute lookup for nodes is context sensitive, thereby
		  allowing alternative descriptions to be created and
		  manipulated. This paper first reviews Smalltalk, then
		  discusses our implementation of each of the above
		  capabilities within PIE, a Smalltalk system for representing

		  provide services such as address resolution and routing to

		  considering its interaction with the rest of the system.This
		  paper presents a method for hardware synthesis from an
		  "operation centric" description, where the behavior of a
		  system is described as a collection of "atomic" operations in
		  the form of rules.  Typically, a rule is defined by a
		  predicate condition and an effect on the state of the system.
		  The atomicity requirement simplifies the task of hardware
		  description by permitting the designer to formulate each rule
		  as if the rest of the system is static.An implementation can
		  execute several rules concurrently in a clock cycle, provided
		  some sequential execution of those rules can reproduce the
		  behavior of the concurrent execution.  In fact, detecting and
		  scheduling valid concurrent execution of rules is the central
		  issue in hardware synthesis from operation-centric
		  descriptions.  The result of this paper shows that an
		  operation-centric framework offers significant reduction in
		  design time, without loss in implementation quality.},

		  complement normal classes in object- oriented languages.
		  Like a normal class, a predicate class has a set of
		  superclasses, methods, and instance variables.  However,
		  unlike a normal class, an object is automatically an instance
		  of a predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
		  expression associated with the predicate class.  The
		  predicate expression can test the value or state of the
		  object, thus supporting a form of implicit property-based
		  classification that augments the explicit type-based
		  classification provided by normal classes.  By associating
		  methods with predicate classes, method lookup can depend not
		  only on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
		  dynamic value or state.  If an object is modified, the
		  property-based classification of an object can change over
		  time, implementing shifts in major behavior modes of the
		  object.  A version of predicate classes has been designed and

		  interest in building search/index structures for performing
		  similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image
		  databases, document collections, time-series databases, and
		  genome databases.  Unfortunately, all known techniques for
		  solving this problem fall prey to the "curse of
		  dimensionality." That is, the data structures scale poorly
		  with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of
		  dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and
		  related structures involves the inspection of a large
		  fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than
		  brute-force linear search.  It has been suggested that since
		  the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric
		  in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an
		  approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most
		  practical purposes.  In this paper, we examine a novel scheme
		  for approximate similarity search based on hashing.  The
		  basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to
		  ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for
		  objects that are close to each other than for those that are
		  far apart.  We provide experimental evidence that our method
		  gives significant improvement in running time over other
		  methods for searching in high-dimensional spaces based on
		  hierarchical tree decomposition.  Experimental results also
		  indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively
		  large number of dimensions (more than 50).},

		  programming language has been a lack of programming and
		  analysis tools to aid development and maintenance of C++
		  systems.  One way to make the job of tool developers easier
		  and to increase the quality of the tools they create is to
		  factor out the common components of tools and provide the
		  components as easily (re)used building blocks.  Those
		  building blocks include lexical, syntactic, and semantic
		  analyzers, tailored database derivers, code annotators and
		  instrumentors, and code generators.  From these building
		  blocks, tools such as structure browsers, data-flow
		  analyzers, program/specification verifiers, metrics
		  collectors, compilers, interpreters, and the like can be
		  built more easily and cheaply.  We believe that for C++
		  programming and analysis tools the most primitive building
		  blocks are centered around a common representation of
		  semantically analyzed C++ code.  In this paper we describe
		  such a representation, called Reprise (REPResentation
		  Including SEmantics).  The conceptual model underlying
		  Reprise is based on the use of expressions to capture all
		  semantic information about both the C++ language and code
		  written in C++.  The expressions can be viewed as forming a
		  directed graph, where there is an explicit connection from
		  each use of an entity to the declaration giving the semantics
		  of that entity.  We elaborate on this model, illustrate how
		  various features of C++ are represented, discuss some
		  categories of tools that would create and manipulate Reprise
		  representations, and briefly describe our current
		  implementation.  This paper is not intended to provide a
		  complete definition of Reprise.  Rather, its purpose is to
		  introduce at a high level the basic approach we are taking in

		  Transport (SST) enhances the traditional stream abstraction

    consists in partitioning arrays into symbolic intervals (e.g., [1,i -- 1],
    [i,i], [i + 1,n]), and in associating with each such interval I and each
    array A an abstract variable A[I]; the new idea is to consider relational
    abstract properties phi(A[I], B[I], ...) about these abstract variables,
    and to interpret such a property pointwise on the interval I: l  I, (A[l],
    B[l ],...).  The abstract semantics of our simple programs according to
    these abstract properties has been defined and implemented in a prototype
    tool.  The method is able, for instance, to discover that the result of an

    to prevent deadlocks, and therefore permits maximal runtime concurrency.

    a programming language which combines object-oriented concepts with
    features of scripting languages, such as dynamic dictionaries.  Due to its
    design nature, Python is relatively slow compared to other languages.  It
    operates through compiling the code into powerful bytecode instructions
    that are executed by an interpreter. Python's speed is limited due to its
    interpreter design, and thus there is a significant need to optimize the
    language.  In this paper, we discuss one possible approach and limitations
    in optimizing Python based on bytecode transformations.  In the first stage
    of the proposed optimizer, the bytecode is expanded using function inline
    and loop unrolling.  The second stage of transformations simplifies the
    bytecode by applying a complete set of data-flow optimizations, including
    constant propagation, algebraic simplifications, dead code elimination,
    copy propagation, common sub expressions elimination, loop invariant code
    motion and strength reduction.  While these optimizations are known and
    their implementation mechanism (data flow analysis) is well developed, they
    have not been successfully implemented in Python due to its dynamic
    features which prevent their use.  In this work we attempt to understand
    the dynamic features of Python and how these features affect and limit the
    implementation of these optimizations.  In particular, we consider the
    significant effects of first unrolling and then inlining on the ability to
    apply the remaining optimizations.  The results of our experiments indicate

    authentication across administrative domains is for users to prove their
    identities through a chain of certificates. Certificates allow for general

    approach without certificates.  Local authentication servers pre-fetch and

    During a file access, an authentication server can establish identities for
    users based just on local information.  This approach is particularly
    well-suited to file systems, and it provides a simple and intuitive
    interface that is similar to those found in local access control
    mechanisms.  An implementation of the authentication server and a file

    The host VM optimizes and compiles these traces to machine code, thus
    eliminating the need for a custom just-in-time compiler for the guest VM.

    notation.  Fortress is intended to grow over time to accommodate the
    changing needs of its users.  Our goal is to design and implement a macro
    system that allows for such growth.  The main challenges are (1) to support
    extensions to a core syntax rich enough to emulate mathematical notation,
    (2) to support combinations of extensions from separately compiled macros,
    and (3) to allow new syntax that it is indistinguishable from core language
    constructs.  To emulate mathematical notation, Fortress syntax is specified
    as a parsing expression grammar (PEG), supporting unlimited lookahead.
    Macro definitions must be checked for well-formedness before they are
    expanded and macro uses must be well encapsulated (hygienic, composable,
    respecting referential transparency).  Use sites must be parsed along with
    the rest of the program and expanded directly into abstract syntax trees.
    Syntax errors at use sites of a macro must refer to the unexpanded program
    at use sites, never to definition sites.  Moreover, to allow for many
    common and important uses of macros, mutually recursive definitions should
    be supported.  Our design meets these challenges.  The result is a flexible
    system that allows us not only to support new language extensions, but also
    to move many constructs of the core language into libraries.  New grammar
    productions are tightly integrated with the Fortress parser, and use sites
    expand into core abstract syntax trees.  Our implementation is integrated
    into the open-source Fortress reference interpreter.  To our knowledge,
    ours is the first implementation of a modular hygienic macro system based

    greater control by carriers.  They would drastically reduce the role of the
    end-to-end principle, the main foundation for the success of the Internet,

    Historical precedents from telecommunications for introduction of
    differentiated services and sophisticated charging methods on the Internet
    are discouraging.  The general trend has been towards decreasing price
    discrimination and simpler pricing.  The history of transportation presents
    a different picture, with frequent movements towards increasing price
    discrimination and more complicated pricing (although with many noteworthy
    reversals).  Charging according to the nature of the goods being
    transported has been and continues to be the norm.  Since the incentives to
    price discriminate are increasing, and the ability to do so is also
    growing, it is conceivable that telecommunications might break with its
    historical record and follow the example of transportation.  It is

    used as building blocks to construct a variety of interpreters for
    Lisp-like languages.  The building blocks are joined merely through
    functional composition.  Each building block contributes code to support a
    specific feature, such as numbers, continuations, functions calls, or
    nondeterminism.  The result of composing some number of building blocks is
    a parser, an interpreter, and a printer that support exactly the expression
    forms and data types needed for the combined set of features, and no more.
    The data structures are organized as pseudomonads, a generalization of
    monads that allows composition.  Functional composition of the building
    blocks implies type composition of the relevant pseudomonads.  Our intent
    was that the Haskell type resolution system ought to be able to deduce the
    appropriate data types automatically.  Unfortunately there is a deficiency
    in current Haskell implementations related to recursive data types:
    circularity must be reflected statically in the type definitions.  We
    circumvent this restriction by applying a purpose-built program simplifier
    that performs partial evaluation and a certain amount of program algebra.
    We construct a wide variety of interpreters in the style of Wadler by
    starting with the building blocks and a page of boiler-plate code, writing
    three lines of code (one to specify the building blocks and two to
    (redundantly) specify type compositions), and then applying the simplifier.
    The resulting code is acceptable Haskell code.  We have tested a dozen
    different interpreters with various combinations of features.  In this
    paper we discuss the overall code structuring strategy, exhibit several
    building blocks, briefly describe the partial evaluator, and present a
    number of automatically generated interpreters.",

    high-rate producers are retrieved at query time, while events from
    lower-rate producers are materialized in advance.  A formal analysis of the

    Eager comprehensions are syntactic forms that encapsulate the details of an
    accumulation process (counting elements, creating a list, etc.).  Within
    these forms, expressions called generators hide the details of enumerating
    basic sequences (running through a list,through a range of integers, etc.).
    By combining these elements in a clearly structured and well-defined way, a
    concise and powerful notation for writing loops emerges.  Of course, this
    style of programming is not new--it is implicitly present in any form of
    loop-macro already--and so we discuss several concrete designs that aim for
    the same goal.  Surprisingly, however, none of these designs has had much
    impact on Scheme,despite the fact that their common floor plan has been
    around for decades.  A particularly clean new design, SRFI 42, on the other

    plethora of high quality, public domain Scheme implementations give the
    developer a wide selection of interpreters, byte compilers, and machine
    code compilers to use as targets for her VHLL.  Our VHLL, Rush, provides
    high-level features such as automatic type conversion and production rules
    [SHH86][Ston93].  Performance benchmarks show that our system runs with
    acceptable speed; in fact, Rush programs run much more quickly than their
    equivalents in languages such as Tcl and Perl4.  Whereas those languages
    are coded in C, Rush takes advantage of Scheme's existing high-level
    features, saving development time.  Since the features provided by Scheme
    are among those most VHLLs share, we expect this approach to be widely
    applicable.",

    if no program variables dependent on hardware configuration parameters,
    such as cache size and cache-line length need to be tuned to minimize the
    number of cache misses.  We show that the ordinary algorithms for matrix
    transposition, matrix multiplication, sorting, and Jacobi-style multipass
    filtering are not cache optimal.  We present algorithms for rectangular
    matrix transposition, FFT, sorting, and multipass filters, which are
    asymptotically optimal on computers with multiple levels of caches.  We
    introduce an "ideal-cache" model to analyze our algorithms, and we prove
    that an optimal cache-oblivious algorithm designed for two levels of memory
    is also optimal for multiple levels.  We further prove that any optimal
    cache-oblivious algorithm is also optimal in the previously studied HMM and
    SUMH models.  Algorithms developed for these earlier models are perforce
    cache-aware: their behavior varies as a function of hardware-dependent
    parameters which must be tuned to attain optimality.  Our cache-oblivious

  abstract	= "This paper describes the Viva File System or VIFS, a 
    technique for high performance file allocation on disks.  VIFS uses bitmaps
    to represent both free blocks on the disk and allocated blocks in each
    file.  Allocation bitmaps provide a very fast method of finding blocks
    close to the last allocated block in a file.  Fragments (partial blocks)
    are used to store the overflow from the last file block; the minimum size
    of a fragment is chosen when the file system is initialized.  Conventional
    file systems, such as the Berkeley Fast File System (FFS), can store a file
    containing 96KB of data without using indirect blocks and around 16 MB of
    data for each indirect block.  With the same block size, VIFS can store up
    to about 10 MB of data without using indirect blocks and up to 500 MB of
    data per indirect block.  The design of VIFS allows some previously
    synchronous operations to occur asynchronously, resulting in significant
    speed improvements over FFS.  VIFS provides multiple read-ahead to maintain
    its high speed when several processes are competing for disk accesses. This
    paper provides experimental measurements taken from an implementation of
    Viva in a BSD 4.3 kernel.  The measurements show that VIFS is significantly
    faster than FFS for nearly all file system operations.",

    the user may have a long iterative debugging task.  If the debugger is able
    to stop execution of the program at the point where data gets corrupted, as
    with watchpoints (also known as data breakpoints), it may be a very simple
    task to find a data corruption bug.  In this paper, we discuss a method of
    implementing watchpoints on a system without hardware watchpoint support.
    By instrumenting the program code to check memory accesses, and supplying
    an interface to the instrumentation in the debugger, we provide an
    efficient, general method of implementing watchpoints."

		  object world. In particular, a parser is an object. Unlike
		  YACC, several independent parsers can co-exist in a single
		  program.
		  We show how to generate a Mango parser and how to use it by
		  means of an example: a simple expression

		  abstraction that arose from the database community.
		  Application programmers can treat a sequence of operations as
		  an atomic ("all-or-nothing") unit and rely on the runtime
		  environment to guarantee serializability of concurrent
		  transactions and persistence of effects of committed
		  transactions. In this report, we present interfaces,
		  expressed in Standard ML, for creating and controlling
		  transactions. Unlike other transaction-based high-level
		  programming languages such as Argus and Avalon, Venari/ML is
		  the first to support multi-threaded transactions, where each
		  transaction may have multiple threads of control executing
		  within its scope. We present a set of simple examples that
		  show how to use Venari/ML interfaces individually and also in
		  some useful combinations. We also present a larger example of
		  searching a database of BibTeX entries. This report is
		  intended primarily for use by an SML programmer whose
		  application requires transactional properties.
		  Our work on transactions in the context of SML led to our
		  invention of a new control abstraction, called a skein, which
		  is a group of threads that cooperate on a single task. Skeins
		  take as parameters initialization and completion functions;
		  transactions are easily constructed as a special case of
		  skeins.
		  The Venari/ML interfaces are cast in terms of SML's modules
		  facility. Modules support a separation of concerns, e.g.,
		  persistence from undoability, that are often tightly
		  integrated in other transaction-based programming
		  languages. We make extensive use of closures in SML, allowing
		  us at runtime to compose different functions, each of which
		  supports a different feature of transactions.},

		  In this paper, we present the design of ALPHA, a Hybrid
		  Executable Intermediate Representation.  ALPHA is a hybrid in
		  the sense that it combines a structured abstract syntax tree
		  (AST) representation with a structured graph representation.
		  The AST representation has been designed to support general,
		  pervasive and accurate dependence analysis for imperative
		  languages with pointer data structures.  In particular, our
		  AST representation supports a location-based alias analysis
		  that is implemented using abstract interpretation techniques.
		  Aliasing information collected by the structured alias
		  analysis is used to build the other part of the hybrid: a
		  structured graph representation that encodes dependence
		  information.  As well as exposing parallelism, this graph
		  representation can be used for sparse flow analyses and
		  transformations.  Our graph representation is based on
		  argument-fetching style dataflow graphs [DG88].  The
		  executable nature of these graphs facilitates systematic
		  algorithm development and verification of correctness.
		  Furthermore, unlike most dataflow-model intermediate
		  representations, which are based on token-pushing semantics,
		  our graph representation supports an imperative (multiple
		  updatable) storage model while keeping a well-defined
		  operational semantics.  This allows us to fully support
		  imperative programs even in the presence of pointers.  We are
		  currently implementing ALPHA as a part of the McCAT (McGill
		  Compiler/Architecture Testbed) compiler.  In this paper we
		  present the methods used to build ALPHA graphs, and we
		  illustrate the use of ALPHA for two case studies: constant
		  propagation and induction variables detection.",

    problems, such as designs that are deficient with respect to either or both
    concepts, that result in overlap or interference between the

    must be treated as separate, although not independent, aspects of language
    design. We begin by offering definitions of inheritance and subtyping that
    help in characterizing the relationship between these concepts.  In light
    of these definitions, we briefly review the variety of inheritance and
    subtyping mechanisms found in modern programming languages.  We then
    advance a notion that we call behavioral abstraction.  Based upon that

    performed on data in the language are those sanctioned by the type of the
    data.  Java is not type-safe, though it was intended to be.  A Java object
    may read and modify fields (and invoke methods) private to another object.
    It may read and modify internal Java Virtual Machine (JVM) data-structures.
    It may invoke operations not even defined for that object, causing
    completely unpredictable results, including JVM crashes (core dumps).  Thus
    Java security, which depends strongly on type-safety, is completely
    compromised.  Java is not type-safe because it allows a very powerful way
    of organizing the type-space at run-time (through user-extensible class
    loaders ).  This power can be utilized to write a program that exposes some
    flawed design decisions in the Java Virtual Machine. Specifically, one can
    produce a class A and an associated ersatz class A' which can "spoof" A:
    its name N is the same as A, but it defines members (fields and methods)
    arbitrarily differently from A.  A "bridge " class B can be defined which
    delivers to a class D (for which the name N is associated with A') an
    instance of A.  D can then operate on this instance as if it is an instance
    of A', thus violating type-safety.  There are two ways in which the
    violation of type-safety may be addressed.  I identify a necessary and
    sufficient conditions on class loaders such that if all the classloaders
    definable in a Java program satisfy this condition, then the program will
    not have any "bridge" classes at run-time, and hence will not exhibit this
    kind of type-spoofing.  Thus one may still informally argue that a
    particular Java program may not exhibit this kind of type-spoofing, and one
    may design Java programs in the future to satisfy this condition.  A
    reading of the informal description of class loaders given in HotJava
    indicate that it may satisfy this condition.  For the language to be
    type-safe however --- a far more desirable alternative --- either the
    classloader interface must be redesigned or the JVM must be fixed.  I argue
    that arbitrary user-definable classloaders represent a significant
    conceptual advance in Java, and should not be limited in any way.  On the
    other hand, I show that the JVM design can be fixed (without any run-time
    penalites) by fixing the (link-time) constant pool resolution process to
    take into account information available at link-time and not just
    compile-time.  Interestingly, this also points out that Java is actually a
    rather impoverished language for programming the Java Virtual Machine --
    programs cannot be written in Java which exploit (in a type-safe way) some
    of the capabilities of the JVM to manipulate classes loaded in different
    class-loaders.  Further study is needed to determine if there are any other
    ways in which type-safety can be compromised in Java.},

    algorithm for changing pointers or state data.  The self-organizing rule is
    designed to get the structure into a good state so that future operations
    can be processed efficiently. Self-organizing data structures differ from
    constraint structures in that no structural invariant, such as a balance
    constraint in a binary search tree, has to be satisfied.  In the area of
    self-organizing linear lists we present a series of deterministic and
    randomized on-line algorithms.  We concentrate on competitive algorithms,
    i.e., algorithms that have a guaranteed performance with respect to an
    optimal offline algorithm.  In the area of binary search trees we present
    both on-line and off-line algorithms.  We also discuss a famous
    self-organizing on-line rule called splaying and present important theorems
    and open conjectures on splay trees.  In the third part of the paper we

    programs with graphical user interfaces in purely functional languages.
    The method is based on a new abstraction called the fudget.  The method
    makes good use of key abstraction powers of functional languages, such as
    higher order functions and parametric polymorphism.  The Fudget concept is
    defined in terms of the simpler concept of stream processors, which can be
    seen as a simple, but practically useful incarnation of the process
    concept.  Programs based on fudgets and stream processors are networks of
    communicating processes that are built hierarchically, using combinators.
    Communication is type safe.  The basic combinators provide serial
    compositions, parallel compositions, and loops.  A key difference between
    previous work on stream processing functions and our approach is that we
    deliberately abstract away from the streams.  We obtain a system that can
    be implemented deterministically, entirely within a purely functional
    language, but which also makes it possible to take advantage of parallel
    evaluation and indeterminism, where such is available within the functional
    language.  The purely functional approach makes processes first class
    values and makes it easy to express process cloning and process migration.
    The practical viability of the approach is demonstrated by the Fudget
    library, which is an implementation of a graphical user interface toolkit
    in the purely functional language Haskell, together with a number of small
    an large applications that have been implemented on top of the library. In
    addition to GUI programming, fudgets are suitable for other forms of
    concurrent I/O programming.  We demonstrate how client/server based
    applications can be we written, with type safe communication between client
    and server.  We show a web browser as an example where GUI programming and
    network communication come together.  We view fudgets as one example of a
    more general combinator-based approach to promote the idea that a
    functional language together with combinator libraries is a good
    alternative to using less expressive languages propped by
    application-specific tools.  We describe a set of combinators, reminiscent
    of parsing combinators, for building syntax-directed editors.",

    server.  Despite the decentralized nature of the protocol, BitTorrent has
    traditionally relied on a centralized tracker, which bootstraps the system
    by providing new clients with a random set of peers.  The tracker has
    previously been perceived as a critical part of BitTorrent systems, and
    efforts to make it more fault-tolerant have focused on tracker replication
    and on tracker implementations using Distributed Hash Tables, which have
    been entitled "Trackerless BitTorrent." The tracker's sole responsibility,
    whether implemented in a centralized or distributed manner, is to allow
    peers to randomly select other peers to connect to, in an effort to
    construct a robust graph.  We propose completely removing the tracker and
    replacing it with a set of distributed protocols based on random walks,
    accomplishing the work of the tracker without explicitly tracking every
    peer in the system.  We use expansion as a measure by which to compare the
    quality of the graphs generated by distributed, trackerless algorithms to
    the graphs generated by a centralized tracker.  We also explore the
    implications of various design decisions related to the random walks which
    are the key component of our proposal.},

  abstract     = "The purpose of this monograph is to provide both an 
    introduction to field of asynchronous digital circuit design and an
    overview of the practical state of the art in 1997.  In the early days of
    digital circuit design, little distinction was made between synchronous and
    asynchronous circuits.  However, since the 1960's, the mainstream of the
    digital circuit design enterprise has been primarily concerned with
    synchronous circuits.  Synchronous circuits may be simply defined as
    circuits which are sequenced by one or more globally distributed periodic
    timing signals called clocks.  Asynchronous circuits are an inherently
    larger class of circuits, since there are may sequencing options other than
    global periodic clock signals.  Asynchronous circuits have been studied in
    one form or another since the early 1950's [92] when the focus was
    primarily on mechanical relay circuits.  A number of theoretical issues
    were studied in detail by Muller and Bartky as early as 1956 [138].  Since
    then, the field of asynchronous circuits has gone through a number of
    high-interest cycles.  In recent years there has been an unprecedented
    level of interest in both academic and industrial settings [81].  Much of
    this recent research effort has focused more on theory than practice.
    Nonetheless, the advance of practical asynchronous circuit design
    techniques also has an unusual level of interest.  The focus of this
    document is on the aspects of the asynchronous circuit design discipline
    which are either likely, or have been an influence on the practical design
    of asynchronous circuits.  The attempt is to provide an introduction to the
    basic concepts which provide the foundation for today's design techniques
    and to summarize the current practice.  The text contains an extensive set
    of bibliographical pointers to guide the more serious student of the

    the fact that the authorities who might naturally be expected to take
    action have often (especially in recent years) been among the most
    gullible, and were cheerleaders for the exuberant behavior.  Hence what is
    needed is an objective measure of gullibility.  This paper argues that it
    should be possible to develop such a measure.  Examples demonstrate,
    contrary to the efficient market dogma, that in some manias, even top-level
    business and technology leaders do fall prey to collective hallucinations
    and become irrational in objective terms.  During the Internet bubble, for
    example, large classes of them first became unable to comprehend compound
    interest, and then lost even the ability to do simple arithmetic, to the
    point of not being able to distinguish 2 from 10.  This phenomenon,
    together with advances in analysis of social networks and related areas,
    points to possible ways to develop objective and quantitative tools for
    measuring gullibility and other aspects of human behavior implicated in
    bubbles.  It cannot be expected to infallibly detect all destructive
    bubbles, and may trigger false alarms, but it ought to alert observers to
    periods where collective investment behavior is becoming irrational.  The

		 program transformations.  The framework consists of the
		 transformation language Stratego and the XT collection of
		 transformation tools.  Stratego is based on the paradigm of
		 rewriting under the control of programmable rewriting
		 strategies.  The XT tools provide facilities for the
		 infrastructure of transformation systems including parsing
		 and pretty-printing.  The framework addresses the entire range
		 of the development process; from the specification of
		 transformations to their composition into transformation
		 systems.  This paper gives an overview of the main ingredients
		 involved in the composition of transformation systems with
		 Stratego/XT, where we distinguish the abstraction levels of
		 rules, strategies, tools, and systems.",

  abstract     = "Assuring and evolving concurrent programs requires
    understanding the concurrency-related design decisions used in their
    implementation.  In Java-style shared-memory programs, these decisions
    include which state is shared, how access to it is regulated, and the
    policy that distinguishes desired concurrency from race conditions.  Source
    code often does not reveal these design decisions because they rarely have
    purely local manifestations in the code, or because they cannot be inferred
    from code.  Many programmers believe it is too difficult to explicate the
    models in ordinary practice.  As a result, this design intent is usually
    not expressed, and it is therefore generally infeasible to assure that
    concurrent programs are free of race conditions.  This thesis is about a
    practicable approach to capturing and expressing design intent, and,
    through the use of annotations and composable static analyses, assuring
    consistency of code and intent as both evolve.  We use case studies from
    production Java code and a prototype analysis tool to explore the costs and
    benefits of a new annotation-based approach for expressing design intent.
    Our annotations express mechanical properties that programmers must already
    be considering, such as lock--state associations, uniqueness of references,
    and conceptual aggregations of state.  Our analyses reveal race conditions
    in a variety of case study samples which were drawn from library code and
    production open source projects.  We developed a prototype tool that
    embodies static analysis techniques for assuring consistency between code
    and models (expressed as code annotations).  Our experience with the tool
    provides some preliminary evidence of the practicability of our approach
    for ordinary programmers on deadlines.  The dominant design consideration
    for the tool was adherence to the principle of early gratification--some
    assurance can be obtained with minimal or no annotation effort, and
    additional increments of annotation are rewarded with additional increments
    of assurance.  The novel technical features of this approach include (1)
    regions as flexible aggregations of state that can cross object boundaries,
    (2) a region-based object-oriented effects system; (3) analysis to track
    the association of locks with regions, (4) policy descriptions for
    allowable method interleavings, and (5) an incremental process for
    inserting, validating, and exploiting annotations.",

    Internet has achieved the critical mass necessary to support new classes of
    wide-area distributed applications, including electronic commerce, news
    services, multi-player gaming, and interactive multimedia.  Unfortunately,
    robust deployment of such applications is hampered by limited latency,
    bandwidth, and availability of Internet services deployed at a single
    centralized site.  This dissertation advocates the construction of virtual
    services able to dynamically migrate and replicate across the wide area.
    However, such virtual services requires a rethinking of all aspects of
    distributed services, including naming, persistent storage, remote
    execution, and security.  The hypothesis of this dissertation is that
    remotely programmable network elements allow for a restructuring of
    wide-area systems that will improve wide-area resource utilization,
    simplify application development, and improve end-to-end performance.  To
    support our hypothesis we propose novel solutions to address the unique
    requirements of distributed applications for wide-area naming, persistent
    storage, and security.  A principle that cuts across all of our solutions
    is flexibility. The heterogeneity of the wide-area network, clients, and
    service providers dictates that no single policy is appropriate for all
    applications in all situations.  By including flexibility in our solutions
    from the ground up, we ensure that our techniques are applicable to a wide
    variety of distributed applications.  Further, with flexibility, our
    techniques are likely to remain applicable as the Internet and its
    applications continue to evolve.  This dissertation makes the following
    specific contributions in support of virtual services by proposing and
    evaluating: (i) location-independent programs to find and retrieve
    wide-area resources, (ii) combining communication and persistence in a
    locationindependent file system with flexible cache coherence policies,
    (iii) techniques for caching the results of dynamically generated Web
    content, and (iv) a wide-area security system that provides high
    performance and availability despite network limitations, fine-grained
    control over remotely programmable resources, and rights transfer and
    revocation between multiple administrative domains.  This dissertation also
    demonstrates that integrating these techniques simplifies the development
    of a number of wide-area applications, including a Web server capable of
    dynamically replicating itself across the wide area in response to client
    access patterns.",

    mechanism a file system employs to manage keys will fail to support many
    types of use.  We propose separating key management from file system
    security, letting the world share a single global file system no matter how
    individuals manage keys.  We present SFS, a secure file system that avoids
    internal key management.  While other file systems need key management to
    map file names to encryption keys, SFS file names effectively contain
    public keys, making them self-certifying pathnames.  Key management in SFS
    occurs outside of the file system, in whatever procedure users choose to
    generate file names.  Self-certifying pathnames free SFS clients from any
    notion of administrative realm, making inter-realm file sharing trivial.
    They let users authenticate servers through a number of different
    techniques.  The file namespace doubles as a key certification namespace,
    so that people can realize many key management schemes using only standard
    file utilities.  Finally, with self-certifying pathnames, people can
    bootstrap one key management mechanism using another.  These properties
    make SFS more versatile than any file system with built-in key
    management.",

    ranging from software engineering to computational biology.  While graph
    theory and graph algorithms are some of the oldest, most studied fields in
    computer science, the problem of visualizing graphs is comparatively young.
    This problem, known as graph drawing, is that of transforming combinatorial
    graphs into geometric drawings for the purpose of visualization.  Most
    published algorithms for drawing general graphs model the drawing problem
    with a physical analogy, representing a graph as a system of springs and
    other physical elements and then simulating the relaxation of this physical
    system.  Solving the graph drawing problem involves both choosing a
    physical model and then using numerical optimization to simulate the
    physical system.  In this dissertation, we improve on existing algorithms
    for drawing general graphs.  The improvements fall into three categories:
    speed, drawing quality, and flexibility.  We improve the speed using known
    techniques from both the many-body work in astrophysics and the numerical
    optimization literature.  We improve drawing quality both by making our
    physical model more comprehensive than those in the literature and by
    employing heuristics in our optimization procedure to avoid poor local
    minima.  Finally, we improve the flexibility of existing approaches both by
    cleanly separating the physical model from the optimization procedure and
    by allowing the model to include a broad class of constraints.  We are able
    to demonstrate some of our improvements through theoretical analysis.  To
    demonstrate the others, we use an implementation of our approach in the
    Java programming language.",
