  abstract	= "A traditional protocol implementation typically consists of 
    at least two distinct parts, a sender and a receiver.  Each part runs on a
    distinct machine, with the implementation provided by a local expert.  At
    best, the two machines are of the same type and the protocol
    implementations are provided by the same person.  More likely, however, the
    machines are not of the same type and the implementations of the two halves
    of the protocol are provided by two different people,working from an often
    loosely defined protocol specification.  It seems almost unavoidable that
    the two implementations are not quite compatible.In this paper we consider
    an alternative technique.  With this method, one of the two implementors
    can design, formally validate, and implement all the relevant protocol
    parts, including those parts that are to be executed remotely.  Each
    communication channel is now terminated on the receiving side, by a single
    standard protocol interface, which can be called a universal asynchronous
    protocol interface, or UAPI.  Though it is likely that the UAPI is most
    efficiently implemented in hardware, it can also trivially run as a
    software module, e.g.  under a standard UNIX(R) operating system (in our
    case under 10th Edition Research Unix).  This paper introduces the concept
    of a UAPI and explains how the sample software controller was constructed."

  abstract = 	{Busy-wait techniques are heavily used for mutual exclusion
    and barrier synchronization in shared-memory parallel programs.
    Unfortunately, typical implementations of busy-waiting tend to produce
    large amounts of memory and interconnect contention, introducing
    performance bottlenecks that become markedly more pronounced as
    applications scale.  We argue that this problem is not fundamental, and
    that one can in fact construct busy-wait synchronization algorithms that
    induce no memory or interconnect contention.  The key to these algorithms
    is for every processor to spin on separate locally-accessible flag
    variables, and for some other processor to terminate the spin with a single
    remote write operation at an appropriate time.  Flag variables may be
    locally-accessible as a result of coherent caching, or by virtue of
    allocation in the local portion of physically distributed shared memory.
    We present a new scalable algorithm for spin locks that generates 0(1)
    remote references per lock acquisition, independent of the number of
    processors attempting to acquire the lock.  Our algorithm provides
    reasonable latency in the absence of contention, requires only a constant
    amount of space per lock, and requires no hardware support other than a
    swap-with-memory instruction.  We also present a new scalable barrier
    algorithm that generates 0(1) remote references per processor reaching the
    barrier, and observe that two previously-known barriers can likewise be
    cast in a form that spins only on locally-accessible flag variables.  None
    of these barrier algorithms requires hardware support beyond the usual
    atomicity of memory reads and writes.  We compare the performance of our
    scalable algorithms with other software approaches to busy-wait
    synchronization on both a Sequent Symmetry and a BBN Butterfly.  Our
    principal conclusion is that contention due to synchronization need not be
    a problem in large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors.  The existence of
    scalable algorithms greatly weakens the case for costly special-purpose
    hardware support for synchronization, and provides a case against so-called
    “dance hall” architectures, in which shared memory locations are equally
    far from all processors.},

    these same algorithms can also be used to detect the presence of data flow

    (the HM-Nucleus) for the HM contains a communications subsystem that
    provides low-overhead communications, both for user processes and for the
    rest of the HM-Nucleus, using the shared memory, the signalling capability,
    and the H-Network.  The design for the communications subsystem provides
    uniformity of access to the three mechanisms by following the IEEE
    802.2/802.3 LLC/MAC specifications.  Flexibility of access is achieved by
    adopting the STREAMS facility from System V UNIX.A new implementation of
    STREAMS has been built using Turing Plus for both the programming and the
    simulation/testing, with no need to access the actual hardware until final
    test.  Completion of the STREAMS framework has made it possible
    subsequently to code an 802.2 LLC module and an 802.3 - based shared memory
    driver very quickly.The STREAMS framework has also made it feasible to cast
    some algorithms used by other parts of the HM-Nucleus as protocols, and
    implement them as STREAMS modules, resulting in considerable simplification
    in the design process.  Since the framework was designed to be completely
    independent of the host processor, it provides a very general vehicle for
    protocol development.",

    such systems, where both upward and downward control flow are required, to
    use efficient synchronous procedure calls between the layers whenever
    possible.  The term upcall is used by Clark to describe this synchronous
    upward communication from server to client.  Several techniques are
    possible for structuring such programs using upcalls.  Comparisons are made
    by implementing a communication protocol described by Clark in three
    different ways.  The first method implements all the protocol routines in a
    single large module.  The second method structures the routines into
    modules occupying vertical slices of the protocol layers, and the third
    method structures the routines into modules corresponding to the protocol
    layers.  Comparisons are made on two fronts: Preservation of modularity, in
    order to determine which method shows fault-tolerance and ease of
    programming, and program performance, which is a key motivation for the
    upcalls programming style.  We conclude that the vertically layered
    protocol design is to be preferred unless there are many shared variables
    between the send-side and receive-side, as it is very efficient and
    provides the best protection of clients from each other.  The horizontally
    layered design is the least efficient, but it is the easiest to program.",

  abstract     = "While a compiler produces low-level object code from
    high-level source code, a decompiler produces high-level code from
    low-level code and has applications in the testing and validation of
    safety-critical software.  The decompilation of an object code provides an
    independent demonstration of correctness that is hard to better for
    industrial purposes (an alternative is to prove the compiler correct).
    But, although compiler compilers are in common use in the software
    industry, a decompiler compiler is much more unusual.  It turns out that a
    data type specification for a programming-language grammar can be remolded
    into a functional program that enumerates all of the abstract syntax trees
    of the grammar.  This observation is the springboard for a general method
    for compiling decompilers from the specifications of (nonoptimizing)
    compilers.This paper deals with methods and theory, together with an
    application of the technique.  The correctness of a decompiler generated
    from a simple occam-like compiler specification is demonstrated.  The basic
    problem of enumerating the syntax trees of grammars, and then stopping, is
    shown to have no recursive solution, but methods of abstract interpretation
    can be used to guarantee the adequacy and completeness of our technique in
    practical instances, including the decompiler for the language presented
    here.",

  abstract     = "As continuous evolution in hardware results in more powerful
    computers, new programming techniques and concepts must be developed to
    master the consequently increasing software complexity.  Separate
    compilation of modules is such a technique that has proven valuable in
    Modula-2 and in Oberon, among other strongly-typed programming languages.
    The module is both the structural unit and the compilation unit of
    programs.  Replacing a module by a new one does not affect the rest of the
    system, provided that the module interface has not changed.  Otherwise,
    client modules of the modified interface have to be recompiled to maintain
    system consistency.  The last opportunity to detect an inconsistency is
    when modules are linked to form an executable unit.  The check usually
    consists in comparing, for each imported interface, the expected key of
    that interface, as known at compilation time of the client, with the key of
    the effectively supplied interface.  A mismatch indicates an inconsistency.
    This model is simple and efficient, but not very flexible.  Indeed, a minor
    modification of an interface, such as the insertion of a new procedure, can
    trigger many unnecessary recompilations.  This thesis presents two new
    models for fine-grained consistency checking and their implementation.
    These models allow the interface of separately compiled modules to be
    extended without requiring a recompilation of client modules.  This is
    particularly valuable in systems with dynamic loading, where the clients of
    a library are not known when the library is revised or extended.  Interface
    editing that does not require client recompilation is not restricted to
    extensions, since the modification of an existing item does not invalidate
    clients not using this particular item. Even if they use it in a way that
    is upward-compatible with the modification, they still do not need a
    recompilation.  These techniques have been implemented in the Oberon
    System, but they are neither specific to the Oberon Language nor to the
    Oberon System.  They can be applied to any modular programming system in
    order to improve its safety, its flexibility, or both.  Furthermore, these
    techniques are not available to the programmer as a separate tool whose use
    remains optional, but have been fully and transparently integrated into the
    compiler and module loader.  Safety must not be optional.",

  abstract     = "Modern processor architectures rely on optimizing compilers
		  to achieve high performance. Such architectures expose
		  details of their hardware to the compiler, which has to deal
		  with them in generating machine code. This development has 
		  led to complex and slow compilers, which are difficult to
		  understand, implement, and maintain. This thesis reports on
		  methods to simultaneously reduce the complexity and the
		  compile-time of optimizing compilers by more than a decimal
		  order of magnitude. It presents a novel intermediate program
		  representation, which integrates data- and control-flow into
		  a single data-structure. This provides not just for simpler
		  and faster optimization algorithms, but also for more
		  powerful optimization techniques. The thesis also describes
		  single-pass algorithms to construct this intermediate program
		  representation from structured source code, as well as
		  single-pass techniques to transform programs with restricted
		  kinds of unstructured control-flow like in Oberon into
		  structured form. The integration of these techniques with the
		  parser allows to implement fast and compact front-ends for
		  structured programming languages, that avoid the many
		  auxiliary datak structures other optimizing compilers
		  require. A description of several optimization algorithms and
		  how they can be implemented on this intermediate program
		  representation shows the feasibility of the approach.
		  Most of these techniques have been implemented in a
		  prototypical optimizing compiler translating a subset
		  of the programming language Oberon for the PowerPC
		  architecture. Measurements on this compiler prove that
		  both the complexity and the compile-time of optimizing
		  compilers can be reduced by an order of magnitude when
		  translating a structured programming language and when
		  using this novel intermediate representation and the
		  associated algorithms. The thesis concludes with some
		  feedback to the programming language designers, which
		  language constructs cause undue complications in
		  optimizing compilers and should therefore be omitted."

    historically been studied under the assumption that the data fed to the
    algorithms was uniformly distributed.  This paper examines the behavior of
    checksums and CRC's over real data from various UNIX file systems.  We show
    that, when given real data in small to modest pieces (e.g., 48 bytes), all
    the checksum algorithms have skewed distributions.  These results have
    implications for CRC's and checksums when applied to real data.  They also
    can cause a spectacular failure rate for both the TCP and ones-complement
    Fletcher checksums when trying to detect certain types of packet splices.
    When measured over several large file systems, the 16 bit TCP checksum
    performed about as well as a 10-bit CRC. We show that for
    fragmentation-and-reassembly error models, the checksum contribution of
    each fragment are, in effect, colored by the fragment's offset in the
    splice.  This coloring explains the performance of Fletcher's sum on
    nonuniform data, and shows that placing checksum fields in a packet trailer
    is theoretically no worse than a header checksum field.  In practice, TCP
    trailer sums outperform even Fletcher header sums.",

    type inference and slows down arithmetic-intensive benchmarks.  We discuss

    often depend on the mechanized extraction of information from system
    artifacts.  Some useful kinds of information—source models—are well known:
    call graphs, file dependences, etc.  Predicting every kind of source model
    that a software engineer may need is impossible.  We have developed a
    lightweight approach for generating flexible and tolerant source model
    extractors from lexical specifications.  The approach is lightweight in
    that the specifications are relatively small and easy to write.  It is
    flexible in that there are few constraints on the kinds of artifacts from
    which source models are extracted (e.g., we can extract from source code,
    structured data files, documentation, etc.).  It is tolerant in that there
    are few constraints on the condition of the artifacts.  For example, we can
    extract from source that cannot necessarily be compiled.  Our approach
    extended the kinds of source models that can be easily produced from
    lexical information while avoiding the constraints and brittleness of most
    parser-based approaches.  We have developed tools to support this approach
    and applied the tools to the extraction of a number of different source
    models (file dependences, event interactions, call graphs) from a variety
    of system artifacts (C, C++, CLOS, Eiffel.  TCL, structured data).  We
    discuss our approach and describe its application to extract source models
    not available using existing systems; for example, we compute the
    implicitly-invokes relation over Field tools.  We compare and contrast our
    approach to the conventional lexical and syntactic approaches of generating
    source models.",

		  Decoding, which describes, abstract, binary, and
		  assembly-language representations of machine instructions.
		  Guided by a SLED specification, the New Jersey Machine-Code
		  Toolkit generates bit-manipulating code for use in
		  applications that process machine code.  Programmers can
		  write such applications at an assembly language level of
		  abstraction, and the toolkit enables the applications to
		  recognize and emit the binary representations used by the
		  hardware.  SLED is suitable for describing both CISC and RISC
		  machines; we have specified representations of MIPS R3000,
		  SPARC, Alpha, and Intel Pentium instructions, and toolkit
		  users have written specifications for the Power PC and
		  Motorola 68000.  The article includes representative excerpts
		  from our SPARC and Pentium specifications. SLED uses four
		  elements; fields and tokens describe parts of instructions;
		  patterns describe binary representations of instructions or
		  group of instructions; and constructors map between the
		  abstract and binary levels.  By combining the elements in
		  different ways, SLED supports machine-independent
		  implementations of machine-level concepts like conditional
		  assembly, span-dependent instructions, relocatable addresses,
		  object code, sections, and relocation.  SLED specifications
		  can be checked automatically for consistency with existing
		  assemblers.  The implementation of the toolkit is largely
		  determined by our representations of patterns and
		  constructors.  We use a normal form that facilitates
		  construction of encoders and decoders.  The article describes
		  the normal form and its use.  The toolkit has been used to
		  help build several applications.  We have built a
		  retargetable debugger and a retargetable, optimizing linker.
		  Colleagues have built a dynamic code generator, a decompiler,
		  and an execution-time analyzer.  The toolkit generates
		  efficient code; for example, the linker emits binary up to
		  15% faster than it emits assembly language, making it 1.7-2
		  times faster to produce an a.out directly than by using the
		  assembler.",

    substantially revise the elements of the claim to accommodate it to
    computer networks.  In doing so, they have created a new species of
    property right which is now being applied to a wide variety of automated

		  this criterion, and each of which is easy for programmers to
		  use.  The subtype relation is based on the specifications of
		  the sub- and supertypes; the paper presents a way of

  abstract     = "Security vulnerabilities in software are one of the primary 
    reasons for security breaches, and an important challenge from knowledge
    management perspective is to determine how to manage the disclosure of
    knowledge about those vulnerabilities.  The security community has proposed
    several disclosure mechanisms, such as full vendor, immediate public, and
    hybrid, and has debated about the merits and demerits of these
    alternatives.  In this paper, we study how vulnerabilities should be
    disclosed to minimize the social loss.  We find that the characteristics of
    the vulnerability (vulnerability risk before and after disclosure), cost
    structure of the software user population, and vendor's incentives to
    develop a patch determine the optimal (responsible) vulnerability
    disclosure.  We show that, unlike some existing vulnerability disclosure
    mechanisms that fail to motivate the vendor to release its patch,
    responsible vulnerability disclosure policy always ensures the release of a
    patch. However, we find that this is not because of the threat of public
    disclosure, as argued by some security practitioners.  In fact, not
    restricting the vendor with a time constraint can ensure the patch release.
    This result runs counter to the argument of some that setting a grace
    period always pushes the vendor to develop a patch.  When the vulnerability
    affects multiple vendors, we show that the responsible disclosure policy
    cannot ensure that every vendor will release a patch.  However, when the
    optimal policy does elicit a patch from each vendor, we show that the
    coordinator's grace period in the multiple vendor case falls between the
    grace periods that it would set individually for the vendors in the single
    vendor case.  This implies that the coordinator does not necessarily
    increase the grace period to accommodate more vendors.  We then extend our
    base model to analyze the impact of 1) early discovery and 2) an early
    warning system that provides privileged vulnerability knowledge to selected
    users before the release of a patch for the vulnerability on responsible
    vulnerability disclosure.  We show that while early discovery always
    improves the social welfare, an early warning system does not necessarily
    improve the social welfare.",

    executes RML programs efficiently because it internally represents
    relations as binary decision diagrams, a data structure that is well-known
    as a compact representation of large relations in computer-aided
    verification.  We evaluate RML by giving example programs for several

    computer programs with iteration loops.Given such programs, we have shown
    that for classes of program paths, identified as sequences of simple loop
    paths, there is a characterizing function called a simple loop pattern.
    The key idea of simple loop patterns is that these special functions form a
    base set which can represent any path computation in the given program.  A
    software tool called SILOP has been developed to automatically generate
    these simple loop patterns, and each corresponding sequence of simple loop
    paths can be considered as a test case.  The tester uses each test case,
    and with knowledge of the application program, can generate corresponding
    test data.  This paper also presents a method for selecting the specific
    paths and test data to determine the simple loop pattern reliably.  The
    tester can use this selection method to predict the number of tests
    required.  In order to apply this selection method, the given program must
    be a linear computer program.  The SILOP tool and this test selection
    method have been applied to commercial software; in this paper,this
    computational experience is reported and several examples are given to
    demonstrate the approach.",

    relaxed consistency models.  Unfortunately, the models supported by various
    systems differ from each other in subtle yet important ways.  Furthermore,
    precisely defining the semantics of each model often leads to complex
    specifications that are difficult to understand for typical users and
    builders of computer systems.  The purpose of this tutorial paper is to
    describe issues related to memory consistency models in a way that would be
    understandable to most computer professionals.  We focus on consistency
    models proposed for hardware-based shared-memory systems.  Many of these
    models are originally specified with an emphasis on the system
    optimizations they allow.  We retain the system-centric emphasis,but use
    uniform and simple terminology to describe the different models.  We also
    briefly discuss an alternate programmer-centric view that describes the
    models in terms of program behavior rather than specific system
    optimizations.",

		  Juno-2 is a constraint-based double-view drawing editor that
		  addresses some of these limitations.  Constraints in Juno-2
		  are declarative, and they can include non-linear functions
		  and ordered pairs.  Moreover, the Juno-2 solver is not
		  limited to acyclic constraint systems.  Juno-2 also includes
		  a powerful extension language that allows users to define new
		  constraints.  The system demonstrates that fast constraint
		  solving is possible with a highly extensible, fully

    issues of concurrency and partial failure.  We look at a number of
    distributed systems that have attempted to paper over the distinction
    between local and remote objects, and show that such systems fail to
    support basic requirements of robustness and reliability. These failures
    have been masked in the past by the small size of the distributed systems
    that have been built.  In the enterprise-wide distributed systems foreseen
    in the near future, however, such a masking will be impossible.  We
    conclude by discussing what is required of both systems-level and
    application-level programmers and designers if one is to take distribution
    seriously.",

    interpretations has a number of limitations.  In this paper we consider
    these convetionalized interpretations as architectural styles and provide a
    formal framework for their uniform definition.  In addition to providing a
    template for precisely defining new architectural styles, this framework
    allows for the proof that the notational constraints on a style are
    sufficient to guarantee the meanings of all described systems and provides
    a unified semantic base through which different stylistic interpretations
    can be compared.",

    throughout the life cycle of any software program.  In particular, we are
    interested in the role it plays in the maintenance/evolution of legacy
    programs.  During these phases, analysts often describe programs using
    architectural terminology (e.g., "interfaces", "interprocess
    communication", "layers", "objects").  Our research and development goals
    center on supporting such activities through architectural recovery tools
    that are based on reverse engineering technology.  These tools start with
    existing source code and extract architecture-level descriptions. We have
    implemented a framework for architectural recovery and our experience leads
    us to several observations about the representational needs of a library
    that is populated with families of architecture recognition rules.  This
    paper characterizes the kinds of recognizers we have developed and
    describes an approach for rule parameterization and retrieval.},

		  storage allocation, full upward funargs, and universally
		  polymorphic procedures; the Smalltalk-80 programming system
		  features interactive execution with incremental compilation,
		  and implementation portability.  These features of modern
		  programming systems are among the most difficult to implement
		  efficiently, even individually.  A new implementation of the
		  Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based
		  computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete
		  (object code) compatibility with existing implementations.
		  This paper discusses the most significant optimization
		  techniques developed over the course of the project, many of
		  which are applicable to other languages.  The key idea is to
		  represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more
		  than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.",

    security need not come at the price of centralized control.  To prove it,
    we present SFS, a secure, global, decentralized file system permitting easy
