    result from a multidomain development process, and organizing this work
    requires developers to communicate, cooperate, and coordinate effectively

    Such tasks require working at high levels of abstraction to build systems
    by either integrating information from various design domains or modeling
    different aspects of the same component.  Designers of traditional
    computer-based systems usually rely on component- based techniques that
    parallel the physical architecture.  The model-based approach encompasses
    the component-- centered approach, treating structural decomposition as a
    single model in the overall hierarchy.  Model-centered semantics and
    languages let designers concentrate on the data, computation, or
    communication models that describe complex computer-based SoC requirements.
    Appropriate design semantics specify each system aspect, and the designer
    assembles those aspects into models to define complete systems and
    components.  The developers of Rosetta, a heterogeneous systems-level
    modeling language that supports predictive design analysis, have identified
    mechanisms for defining and composing models that specify multiple domains
    of interest from many perspectives.  Rosetta requirements and domains
    define test cases and generate abstract vectors for each test scenario.
    Several analysis tools are under development for transforming Rosetta into
    existing analysis environments, and the authors are also developing native
    analysis tools for symbolic verification and simulation environments.  The
    authors use Rosetta to provide computation models for customized digital

    However, performance requirements as well as cost and power-consumption

    architecture consists of components ranging from fully programmable

    increasing complexity of embedded- system architectures makes predicting

    An engineer or programmer must still set up hypotheses to use in
    identifying and correcting a failure's root cause.  The author describes a
    new algorithm that promises to relieve programmers of the hit-or- miss
    approach to debugging.  Delta Debugging uses the results of automated
    testing to systematically narrow the set of failure-inducing circumstances.
    Programmers supply a test function for each bug and hardcode it into any
    imperative language.  The test function checks a set of changes to
    determine if the failure is present or if the outcome is unresolved, then
    feeds that information to the Delta Debugging code.  As we discover more
    about the structure of these circumstances and the resulting causality
    chain, we come closer to passing much of the boredom and monotony of
    debugging onto machines.  Debugging can be just as disciplined, systematic,
    and quantifiable as any other area of software engineering--which means
    that we should eventually be able to automate at least part of it.

    design problems inherent in large and complex OO systems.  The authors'
    experience with testing FCD on several applications validates its

    Preplanning, however, created problems in four areas: creating summary
    tables of preaggregated data, placing indexes in the system to
    eliminatescanning large data volumes, putting data into one table instead
    of having tables that join together, and storing the data in sorted order.
    All these activities require prior knowledge of the analysis and reports

    the longer-term goals of analysis and flexibility in the rush to provide
    initial value.  Taking time to consider the project's real purpose, then
    building a correct foundation for it, can assure a better future for the

    software.  The author describes two approaches that help to identify the
    body of knowledge software engineers need to achieve this goal.  The first
    approach derives knowledge requirements from a set of issues identified
    during two standards efforts: the IEEE Std.  1061-1998 for a Software
    Quality Metrics Methodology and the American National Standard Recommended
    Practice for Software Reliability (ANSI /AIAA R-013-1992).  The second
    approach ties these knowledge requirements to phases in the software
    development life cycle.  Together, these approaches define a body of
    knowledge that shows software engineers why and when to measure quality.
    Focusing on the entire software development life cycle, rather than just
    the coding phase, gives software engineers the comprehensive knowledge they
    need to enhance software quality and supports early detection and
    resolution of quality problems.  The integration of product and process
    measurements lets engineers assess the interactions between them throughout
    the life cycle.  Software engineers can apply this body of knowledge as a
    guideline for incorporating quality measurement in their projects.

    potentially reduce memory read stalls by over-lapping read latency with

    in the system.The authors' experience with Rsim demonstrates that modeling
    ILP features is important even in shared-memory multiprocessor systems.  In
    particular, current simple processor-based approximations cannot model
    significant performance effects for applications exhibiting parallel read
    misses.  Further, recent shared-memory designs such as aggressive
    implementations of sequential consistency use the aggressive ILP-enhancing
    features of modern processors that simple processor-based simulators do not
    model.As microprocessor systems become more complex, the availability of
    shared infrastructure source code is likely to become increasingly crucial.

    The reimplementation provides substantially higher throughput rates by
    using more flexible allocation policies that allow better locality of
    reference and can be adapted to a wide range of peripheral and processor
    characteristics.  The new file system clusters data that is sequentially
    accessed and provides two block sizes to allow fast access to large files
    while not wasting large amounts of space for small files.  File access
    rates of up to ten times faster than the traditional UNIX file system are
    experienced.  Long needed enhancements to the programmers' interface are
    discussed.  These include a mechanism to place advisory locks on files,
    extensions of the name space across file systems, the ability to use long
    filenames, and provisions for administrative control of resource usage.",

    of compute-intensive programs on modern processors.  However, there is much
    room for improvement over the auto-vectorization capabilities of current
    production compilers through careful vector-code synthesis that utilizes a
    variety of loop transformations (e.g., unroll-and-jam, interchange, etc.).
    As the set of transformations considered is increased, the selection of the
    most effective combination of transformations becomes a significant
    challenge: Currently used cost models in vectorizing compilers are often
    unable to identify the best choices.  In this paper, we address this
    problem using machine learning models to predict the performance of SIMD
    codes.  In contrast to existing approaches that have used high-level
    features of the program, we develop machine learning models based on
    features extracted from the generated assembly code.  The models are
    trained offline on a number of benchmarks and used at compile-time to
    discriminate between numerous possible vectorized variants generated from
    the input code.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine learning
    model by using it to guide automatic vectorization on a variety of tensor
    contraction kernels, with improvements ranging from 2× to 8× over Intel
    ICC's auto-vectorized code.  We also evaluate the effectiveness of the
    model on a number of stencil computations and show good improvement over
    auto-vectorized code.",

    traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with
    developing conversational interfaces.  However, it is only within the last
    decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale
    working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into
    commercial environments.  As a result many major telecommunications and
    software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue
    technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as
    computer-telephony integration.  Voice portals, which provide a
    speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are
    the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology.  This article
    describes the main components of the technology---speech recognition,
    language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external
    source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis---and
    shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken
    dialogue system.  The article describes in detail the methods that have
    been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system
    architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation,
    reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and

    polymorphic functions to imperative arguments with greater flexibility than
    SML–NJ.  The soundness of the type system is proved for imperative code

    embedded CPU market would follow suit.  Embedded systems provide an ideal
    forum for CPU competition.  A lot of people seemed to want to design CPUs,
    so the author reasoned that no end of new competitors would appear to
    introduce new features and drive down prices.  It hasn't worked out that
    way, however.  The high-end market has several players, but not the

    support a wide variety of applications including human and animal
    detection, surveillance, motion analysis, and facial identification.  Video
    processing has an insatiable demand for real-time performance.  Smart
    cameras leverage very large-scale integration to meet this need in a

    pixel processing and compression, these VLSI systems run a wide range of
    algorithms to extract meaning from streaming video.  Recently, Princeton
    University researchers developed a first-generation smart camera system

    to real-world application development is at fault.  Branching is integral
    to version management, software build correctness, and release management.
    Good decisions about when and why to branch can make it much easier for
    developers and release engineers to coordinate software product changes.
    The right branching strategy makes it easier to deliver the right code,
    re-create past releases, and--if necessary--roll back to a previous
    release.  Adopting the right SCM branching model facilitates rapid
    development, increases overall product quality and process efficiency,
    reduces the incidence of software failures, and improves organizational

    transmission or storage, to be used later in reconstituting an equivalent
    object.  This is accomplished by a mechanism known as pickling [Binel et
    al. 1987; Binell et al. 1994; Herlihy & Liskov 19821.  Pickling is the
    process of creating a serialized representation of objects.  Pickling
    defines the serialized form to include meta information that identifies the
    type of each object and the relationships between objects within a stream.
    Values and types are serialized with enough information to insure that the
    equivalent typed object and the objects to which it refers can be
    recreated.  Unpickling is the complementary process of recreating objects
    from the serialized representation.  Pickling and unpickling extract from
    the Java Virtual machine, at runtime, any meta information needed to pickle
    the fields of objects.  Class specific methods are only required to
    customize the pickling process.",

    involves a set of1,000 to 5,000 test patterns.  These tests are applied
    through scan chains that operate at about 25 MHz.  Depending in the size of
    the scan chains on the chip, a set of test patterns can take a few seconds
    to execute per chip.  It's easy to see that even a small decrease in either
    the number of patterns or the time to execute them can quickly add up to
    big savings across millions of fabricated chips.  This potential savings
    forms the basis for dynamic scan, a new approach to the well-established
    scan test methodology.  The authors' initial studies indicate that dynamic
    scan could easily reduce the time spent applying test patterns by 40
    percent.  A more theoretical analysis shows a potential savings of as much

    paradigms two systems are described, one using only point-to-point
    messages, the other using broadcasting as well.  The two paradigms and
    their implementations are described briefly.  Their performances on four
    applications are compared: the traveling-salesman problem, alpha-beta
    search, matrix multiplication and the all-pairs shortest paths problem.
    The relevant measurements were obtained on a system consisting of 10
    MC68020 processors connected by an Ethernet.  For comparison purposes, the
    applications have also been run on a system with physical shared memory.
    In addition, the paper gives measurements for the first two applications
    above when Remote Procedure Call is used as the communication mechanism.
    The measurements show that both paradigms can be used efficiently for
    programming large-grain parallel applications, with significant speed-ups.
    The structured shared data-object model achieves the highest speed-ups and
    is easiest to program and to debug.",

    European consortium formed the On-to-Knowledge Project to build an ontology
    based tool suite that efficiently processes the many heterogeneous,

    on the Web.  The consortium's approach integrates semantic Web search

    Rather than depending on agent internal mechanisms, Q seeks to describe how

    establish a bridge between the computing professionals who design agents
    and the scenario writers who design applications.  Thus, we can expect an

    automatic formal system property of computers.  This property has been
    studied by cognitive scientists, but it has yet to be addressed by computer

    circular buffer or timing wheel, it takes O(1) time to start, stop, and
    maintain timers within the range of the wheel.Two extensions for larger

    hashed into a slot on the timing wheel.  In the second, a hierarchy of
    timing wheels with different granularities is used to span a greater range
    of intervals.  The performance of these two schemes and various

    exist on other operating systems or is so full of bugs as to be unusable.
    Moreover, POSIX isn’t always the best choice.  Non-Unix platforms, such as
    Microsoft Windows, have their own APIs that are better mantained and
    perform better on that platform.  So, to make something portable, you could
    write, rewrite, and tweak your code several times — at least so the code
    compiles on several platforms.  Or, you can use the Apache Portable Runtime
    (http://apr.apache.org/) the same library that makes the ubiquitous Apache

    one simple idea: allow elements in the hash table to have multiple
    potential locations by using multiple hash functions, and allow elements to
    be relocated among potential locations to make room for new elements.  Such
    relocations can cascade, inducing as earch-tree to find an empty slot, and

    a pointer variant that has more functionality than is provided by the
    basic, language-defined pointer.  For example, type-accurate garbage
    collection, reference counting, or transparent references to distributed or
    persistent objects, might be implemented with classes that provide pointer
    functionality.  The C++ language directly supports one kind of pointer
    substitute,the smart pointer, in the form of overloadable indirection
    operators: -> and * .  In this paper we evaluate how seamlessly smart
    pointers can replace raw pointers.  The ideal is for client code not to
    care whether it is using raw pointers or smart pointers.  For example, if a
    typedef selects whether raw or smart pointers are used throughout the
    program, changing the value of the typedef should not introduce syntax
    errors.  Unfortunately, C++ does not support pointer substitutes well
    enough to permit seamless integration.  This paper presents the desired
    behavior of smart pointers in terms of the semantics of raw pointers that
    the smart pointers try to emulate.  Then,we describe several ways of
    implementing smart pointers.  For each, we show cases in which the
    smart-pointers fail to behave like raw pointers.  From among the choices,
    we explain which is the best for emulating the standard pointer
    conversions.  Accessors are similar to smart pointers, but have certain
    advantages.  This paper discusses the differences between accessors and
    smart pointers, and shows why our conclusions about type conversion
    behavior also apply to accessors.  Whether a programmer prefers smart
    pointers or accessors, this paper shows the limitations and recommends an
    implementation."

    using precompilation techniques to augment a C++ source program with code

    functionality that allows the collector to locate the root set for
    collection.  The second transformation augments the C++ program with code

    objects.  This paper describes the precompiler and the garbage collector.

    software engineering lead to a reexamination of the role of binding times
    in programming language implementation.  We can alleviate problems
    associated with these developments by using event-driven processing to
    determine translation binding times.  Our ultimate goal is to clarify the
    effects of different designs on binding times and to reduce binding time
    concerns in the language design process.  Determining the binding time of a
    translation action involves two concerns: the ordering of the action's
    execution relative to other actions and the translation phase in which the
    execution occurs (e.g.  compile time, link-time, or run-time).  Some issues
    that affect these concerns include: how to handle forward references,
    language designs that require dynamic interpretation, the role of link-time
    in languages that allow separate compilation, and how to achieve
    elasticity.  Elasticity occurs when similar translation actions may be
    executed at very different binding times, typically in different
    translation phases.  In particular, the binding time of each translation
    action is determined individually.  Elastic translation, therefore, incurs
    the costs of late bindings only when language flexibility is used by the
    programmer.  Otherwise, the programmer receives the benefits associated
    with static binding times (e.g.  early error notification and efficient
    program execution).  We can model language translation as an event-driven
    process.  Each semantic action needed to translate a program may be viewed
    as an event.  Each event becomes enabled when its required data becomes
    available.  Event-driven translation progresses by executing those events
    initially enabled and continuing with those enabled as a result.  Since
    each action is handled individually, event-driven translation naturally
    determines the proper ordering and phase for executing events and achieves
    elasticity.  We can also generate event-driven translation systems
    automatically.  Automatic generation removes from the language implementor
    the need to understand the event-driven translation model.  In particular,
    event-driven systems can be generated from a known specification formalism
    (i.e.  attribute grammars).  An automatic generator of event-driven
    translators can also provide useful information about binding times during
    the language design process.  Finally, event-driven systems may have
    potential in practical language implementations.  This thesis describes
    translation problems, the event-driven translation model, a generator of
    event-driven translators, a language design based on elasticity, and an
    evaluation of the model for practical language translation.  Elastic
    translation has particular promise in the design and implementation of
    programming environments and command languages.  Event-driven translation
    may also provide the means to quantify well-known design principles such as
    avoiding pre-emptive decisions.",
