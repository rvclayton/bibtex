    with the best wave shape to be impressed on the transmitting medium so as
    to permit of greater speed without undue interference either in the circuit
    under consideration or in those adjacent, while the latter deals with the
    choice of codes which will permit of transmitting a maxi-mum amount of
    intelligence with a given number of signal elements.  It is shown that the
    wave shape depends somewhat on the type of circuit over which intelligence
    is to be transmitted and that for most cases the optimum wave is neither
    rectangular nor a half cycle sine wave as is frequently used but a wave of
    special form produced by sending a simple rectangular wave through a
    suitable network.  The impedances usually associated with telegraph
    circuits are such as to produce a fair degree of signal shaping when a
    rectangular voltage wave is impressed.  Consideration of the choice of
    codes show that while it is desirable to use those involving more than two
    current values, there are limitations which prevent a large number of
    current values being used.  A table of comparisons shows the relative speed
    efficiencies of various codes proposed.  It is shown that no advantages
    result from the use of a sine wave for telegraph transmission as proposed
    by Squier and others and that their arguments are based on erroneous

    not scale to large networks and route reflection can introduce problems
    such as protocol oscillations and persistent loops.  Instead, we argue that
    a Routing Control Platform (RCP) should collect information about external

    router in an AS.  RCP is a logically-centralized platform, separate from
    the IP forwarding plane, that performs route selection on behalf of routers
    and communicates selected routes to the routers using the unmodified iBGP

    this paper, we present the design and implementation of an RCP prototype on
    commodity hardware.  Using traces of BGP and internal routing data from a
    Tier-1 backbone, we demonstrate that RCP is fast and reliable enough to
    drive the BGP routing decisions for a large network.  We show that RCP
    assigns routes correctly, even when the functionality is replicated and

    Abstract interpretation of programs consists in using that denotation to
    describe computations in another universe of abstract objects, so that the
    resulta of abstract execution give some informations on the actual
    computations.  An intuitive example (which we borrow from Sintzoff [72]) is
    the rule of signs.  The text -1515*17 may be undestood to denote
    computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (+-)} where the semantics
    of arithmetic operators is defined by the rule of signs.  The abstract
    execution -1515*17 ==> -(+)*(+) ==> (-)*(+) ==> (-), proves that -1515+17
    is a negative number.  Abstract interpretation is concerned by a particlar
    underlying structure of the usual universe of computations (the sign, in
    our example).  It gives a summay of some facets of the actual executions of
    a program.  In general this summary is simple to obtain but inacurrate
    (e.g.  -1515+17 ==> -(+)+(+) ==> (-)+(+) ==> (+-)).  Despite its

    using multiple connections can improve available parallelism.  We also
    demonstrate that packet ordering plays a key role in determining
    single-connection TCP performance, that careful use of locks is a

    synchronization, race conditions result when accesses to shared memory are
    not properly synchronized.  Race conditions are often considered to be
    manifestations of bugs, since their presence can cause the program to
    behave unexpectedly.  Unfortunately, there has been little agreement in the
    literature as to precisely what constitutes a race condition.  Two
    different notions have been implicitly considered: one pertaining to
    programs intended to be deterministic (which we call general races) and the
    other to nondeterministic programs containing critical sections (which we
    call data races).  However, the differences between general races and data
    races have not yet been recognized.  This paper examines these differences
    by characterizing races using a formal model and exploring their
    properties.  We show that two variations of each type of race exist:
    feasible general races and data races capture the intuitive notions desired
    for debugging and apparent races capture less accurate notions implicitly
    assumed by most dynamic race detection methods.  We also show that locating
    feasible races is an NP-hard problem, implying that only the apparent
    races, which are approximations to feasible races, can be detected in
    practice.  The complexity of dynamically locating apparent races depends on
    the type of synchronization used by the program.  Apparent races can be
    exhaustively located efficiently only for weak types of synchronization
    that are incapable of implementing mutual exclusion.  This result has
    important implications since we argue that debugging general races requires
    exhaustive race detection and is inherently harder than debugging data
    races (which requires only partial race detection).  Programs containing
    data races can therefore be efficiently debugged by locating certain easily
    identifiable races.  In contrast, programs containing general races require
    more complex debugging techniques.",

    of reviewing and revising standards every five years, and there was good
    reason for considering the task.  Over the intervening five years, the

    could be usefully incorporated into the Reference Model itself.  In
    addition, the addendum describing connectionless mode, i.e.  datagrams, had
    been completed several years before and needed to be incorporated.  There
    was also considerable demand for interworking connection-mode and
    connectionless mode communication, something not supported by the Reference
    Model or any architecture.  Also, when the original version of the
    Reference Model was frozen about 1983 some aspects of OSI such as the upper
    layers were not well understood and were only described in the most cursory
    manner.  And while connection-mode and connectionless mode had been brought
    within OSI, there was no indication as to how broadcast and multicast were
    to be handled.  Thus, the revision might be able to provide a more

    popular in social studies of science [2]–[4].  In support of his argument
    Gould presented the case of Samuel George Morton, a 19th-century physician
    and physical anthropologist famous for his measurements of human skulls.
    Morton was considered the objectivist of his era, but Gould reanalyzed
    Morton's data and in his prize-winning book The Mismeasure of Man [5]
    argued that Morton skewed his data to fit his preconceptions about human
    variation.  Morton is now viewed as a canonical example of scientific
    misconduct.  But did Morton really fudge his data? Are studies of human
    variation inevitably biased, as per Gould, or are objective accounts
    attainable, as Morton attempted? We investigated these questions by
    remeasuring Morton's skulls and reexamining both Morton's and Gould's
    analyses.  Our results resolve this historical controversy, demonstrating

    timescales over which such new control architectures can be introduced
    might vary from, for example, a video conferencing specific control
    architecture, which is active only for the duration of the conference, to a
    new version of a general purpose control architecture, which might be
    active for several months or longer.  Second, the Tempest framework allows
    refinement of services at a finer level of granularity by means of the
    connection closure concept.  In this case modification of services can be
    performed at an application-specific level.  These attributes of the
    Tempest framework allows service providers to effectively become network
    operators for some well defined partition of the physical network.  This
    enables them to take advantage of the knowledge they possess about how the
    network resources are to be used, by programming their own specially

    Our analysis also shows that symmetric cryptographic schemes, while having
    better performance than asymmetric cryptographic-based schemes, impose
    prohibitive overhead in the presence of multiple byzantine adversaries.  We
    further evaluate these schemes by using a set of typical network coding

    The designs surveyed in this article include read before write, wear

    meaning the overall likelihood that a particular route is encountered, and
    persistence, the likelihood that a route remains unchanged over a long
    period of time.  We find that Internet paths are heavily dominated by a
    single prevalent route, but that the time periods over which routes persist
    show wide variation, ranging from seconds up to days.  About 2/3's of the
    Internet paths had routes persisting for either days or weeks.  For routing

    bugs.  These problems are especially frustrating when the developer is a
    student in a compiler class.  An attractive alternative is to structure a
    compiler as a collection of many fine-grained passes, each of which
    performs a single task.  This structure aligns the implementation of a
    compiler with its logical organization, simplifying development, testing,
    and debugging.  This paper describes the methodology and tools comprising a

    behind is simple: instead of working with untyped regular expressions,
    which is the state of the art of morphology in computational linguistics,
    we use finite functions over hereditarily finite algebraic datatypes.  The
    definitions of these datatypes and functions are the language-dependent
    part of the morphology.  The language-independent part consists of an
    untyped dictionary format which is used for synthesis of word forms, and a
    decorated trie, which is used for analysis.Functional Morphology builds on
    ideas introduced by Huet in his computational linguistics toolkit Zen,
    which he has used to implement the morphology of Sanskrit.  The goal has
    been to make it easy for linguists, who are not trained as functional
    programmers, to apply the ideas to new languages.  As a proof of the
    productivity of the method, morphologies for Swedish, Italian, Russian,
    Spanish, and Latin have already been implemented using the library.  The
    Latin morphology is used as a running example in this article.",

  abstract     = {Electronic mail at Bell Labs is usually routed to a system
    and a user-id.  There are now over 100 BTL UNIX systems connected by the
    UUCP network, and it is more and more of a nuisance to remember where your
    correspondents log in and what user-id they use.  The new utility post
    looks up the real names of people in a database of BTL UNIX users, and
    sends mail appropriately .  The most specific kind of address is of the
    form "ruby.jane.elliott-mh-1273" but everything except "elliott" is
    optional.  When someone has no computer address, the mail is routed to a
    nearby clerk, with appropriate labels so that the mail need merely be
    printed and then put in the company mail.  If the eventual address is not
    only non-electronic but outside the company (e.g.  at AT&T) the mail is
    routed to a clerk near the sender and addressed for the U.S.  Mail.  The
    names, room numbers, and department numbers of all employees are updated
    automatically from the standard company files; user ids can be updated by
    the users themselves, simply by sending the appropriate electronic mail.  A
    line of the form "UPDATE: research!mel IS michael.e.lesk-mh-1274" mailed to
    `postoffice`!mailroom will update the appropriate listing.  As with other
    data bases, there is the usual choice between distributing the database or
    routing all queries to a single site.  The post command may be used with
    local directories of users, or all mail may be sent to a central site which
    has a phone book and then the central site can route and deliver the
    message.  In addition, it is possible to route some mail locally and then
    forward other mail to the central site.  The individual user may also have
    a directory of abbreviations; thus the directory is really a hierarchy of
    directories running through personal directories, local site directories,
    and finally large central directories.},

    determine that it relies on separate consensus about the rules and about
    game state.  An important aspect of Bitcoin's design is the mining
    mechanism, in which participants expend resources on solving computational
    puzzles in order to collect rewards.  This mechanism purportedly protects
    Bitcoin against certain technical problems such as inconsistencies in the
    system's distributed log data structure.  We consider the economics of
    Bitcoin mining, and whether the Bitcoin protocol can survive attacks,
    assuming that participants behave according to their incentives.  We show
    that there is a Nash equilibrium in which all players behave consistently
    with Bitcoin's reference implementation, along with infinitely many
    equilibria in which they behave otherwise.  We also show how a motivated
    adversary might be able to disrupt the Bitcoin system and crash the
    currency.  Finally, we argue that Bitcoin will require the emergence of
    governance structures, contrary to the commonly held view in the Bitcoin
    community that the currency is ungovernable.",
