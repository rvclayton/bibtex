  abstract     = "PegsSys is an experimental system in which a user formally
    describes how a program is put together by means of a hierarchically
    structured collection of pictures, called formal dependency diagrams
    (FDDs).  Icons in an FDD denote a wide range of data and control
    dependencies among the relatively coarse-grained entities contained in
    large programs.  Dependencies considered atomic with respect to one level
    in a hierarchy can be decomposed into a number of dependencies at a lower
    level.  Each dependency can be a predefined primitive of the FDD language
    or it can be defined by a PegaSys user in terms of the primitives.  A
    PegsSys user is given the illusion that logical formulas do not exist, even
    though PegaSys reasons about them internally.  This involves (1) checking
    whether an FDD is meaningful syntactically, (2) determining whether
    hierarchical refinements of an FDD are methodologically sound, and (3)
    deciding whether an FDD hierarchy is logically consistent with the program
    that it is intended to describe.  The techniques used to provide these
    capabilities are discussed along with the logical properties that enable
    PegaSys to maintain the user illusion.",

    disadvantages, depending on the characteristics of the application and the
    underlying parallel-programming system.  In particular, we show that a

    the redundancy that can be eliminated by supercompilation may be various,
    e.g., some variables might have predefined values (as in partial
    evaluation), or the structure of control transfer could be made more
    efficient (as in lazy evaluation), or it could simply be the fact that the
    same variable is used more than once.  The general principles of
    supercompilation are described and compared with the usual approach to
    program transformation as a stepwise application of a number of equivalence
    rules.  It is argued that the language Refal serves the needs of
    supercompilation best.  Refal is formally defined and compared with Prolog

    more memory-intensive set of benchmarks (SPEC2000).  Our results make a
