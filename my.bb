    systems ranging from 3000 to 112000 source lines have been selected for

    of 74 attributes (or metrics), for over 4700 objects, capture a multitude
    of information about the objects: development effort, faults, changes,
    design style, and implementation style.  A total of 9600 decision trees are
    automatically generated and evaluated.  The analysis focuses on the
    characterization and evaluation of decision tree accuracy, complexity, and
    composition.  The decision trees correctly identified 79.3% of the software
    modules that had high development effort or faults, on the average across

    verifier for security, its current descriptions are inadequate.  This
    article proposes using typing rules to describe the bytecode verifier
    because they are more precise than prose, clearer than code, and easier to
    reason about than either.  JVML has a subroutine construct which is used
    for the compilation of Java's try-finally statement.  Subroutines are a
    major source of complexity for the bytecode verifier because they are not
    obviously last-in/first-out and because they require a kind of
    polymorphism.  Focusing on subroutines, we isolate an interesting, small

    makes the language very powerful.  It is powerful enough that a special

    powerful enough to encode predicate logic at the type level, allowing types
    to be used as specifications of programs.  However, this power comes at a
    cost: type checking of Cayenne is undecidable.  While this may appear to be

    was successful, and many databases are now accessible through local and

    realise them, however, often change over time--whether to improve
    performance, or to extend them to new language features--potentially
    affecting behavioural and safety properties of existing programs.  This is
    exemplified by Scoop, a message-passing approach to concurrent
    object-oriented programming that has seen multiple changes proposed and
    implemented, with demonstrable consequences for an idiomatic usage of its
    core abstraction.  We propose a semantics comparison workbench for Scoop
    with fully and semi-automatic tools for analysing and comparing the state
    spaces of programs with respect to different execution models or semantics.
    We demonstrate its use in checking the consistency of properties across
    semantics by applying it to a set of representative programs, and
    highlighting a deadlock-related discrepancy between the principal execution
    models of Scoop.  Furthermore, we demonstrate the extensibility of the
    workbench by generalising the formalisation of an execution model to
    support recently proposed extensions for distributed programming.  Our
    workbench is based on a modular and parameterisable graph transformation
    semantics implemented in the Groove tool.  We discuss how graph
    transformations are leveraged to atomically model intricate language
    abstractions, how the visual yet algebraic nature of the model can be used
    to ascertain soundness, and highlight how the approach could be applied to
    similar languages.",

    in-kernel interpreters to execute extension code; still others use software

    desirable in an extensible operating system, evaluates the performance cost
    of various extension technologies currently being employed, and compares
    the cost of adding a kernel extension to the benefit of having the

    a world in which most software consists of packages which follow an
    evolutionary development model.  Thisleads us to ask whether anything
    interesting and useful may be said about evolutionary development.  We
    answer in the afﬁrmative.  Secondly, existing reliability growth models
    emphasise the Poisson distribution of individual software bugs, while the
    empirically observed reliability growth for large systems is asymptotically
    slower than this.  We provide a rigorous explanation of this phenomenon.
    Our reliability growth model is inspired by statistical thermodynamics, but
    also applies to biological evolution.  It is in close agreement with
    experimental measurements of the ﬁtness of an evolving species and the
    reliability of commercial software products.  However, it shows that there
    are signiﬁcant differences between the evolution of software and the
    evolution of species.  In particular, we establish maximisation properties
