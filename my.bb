  abstract     = "The XS-2 system that integrates specification, rapid
    prototyping, and the actual use of application dialogs is described.  The
    XS-2 command language grammar, a nonprocedural description language based
    on regular expressions, is used to specify commands for any application
    program.  The syntax of the command specification is visible to the user:
    command names and their activation rules are displayed as a command tree.
    Since a small set of tools is provided for the development of the command
    specification and its automatic translation into a prototype application
    module in Modula-2, no programming work is necessary to design and evaluate
    the commands.  Experience shows that an advanced end user can develop his
    or her own prototype application without a programmer's assistance.",
