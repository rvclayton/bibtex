    standard benchmark programs were run on both the PLM and SPUR simulators.
    The compiled code for SPUR was obtained by simple macro-expansion of PLM
    code generated by the PLM Prolog compiler.  The two implementations are
    compared with regard to static and dynamic program size, execution speed,
    and memory system performance.  On average, the macrocoded SPUR
    implementation has a static code size 14 times larger than the PLM,
    executes 16 times more instructions, yet requires only 2.3 times the number
    of machine cycles (or has the performance of 0.43 PLMs).  When memory
    system performance is taken into account, SPUR is equivalent to 0.29 PLMs.
    Optimizations of the macro-expanded code and minor architectural changes to
    SPUR would increase this ratio to 0.53, or 0.60 for the largest benchmarks.

    single instruction from a complex instruction set.  In addition, the
    tendency of simple instructions to be fixed length with a few instruction
    formats also increases object-program size.  Larger object-program size
    could adversely affect memory performance and bus traffic.  This paper
    reports the results of experiments to isolate and determine the effect of
    instruction set complexity on cache memory performance and bus traffic.
    Three high-level language compilers were constructed for machines with
    instruction sets of varying complexity.  Using a set of benchmark programs,
    we evaluated the effect of instruction set complexity had on program size.
    Five of the programs were used to perform a set of trace-driven simulations
    to study each machine's cache and bus performance.  While we found that the
    miss ratio is affected by object program size, it appears that this can be
    corrected by increasing the cache size.  Our measurements of bus traffic,
    however, show that even with large caches, machines with simple instruction

    type checking is implemented by adding to each data     object a tag that
    encodes type information.  Tags must be compared for type compatibility,
    removed when using the data, and inserted when new data items are created.
    This tag manipulation, together with other work related to dynamic type
    checking and generic operations, constitutes a significant component of the
    execution time of LISP programs.  This has led both to the development of
    LISP machines that support tag checking in hardware and to the avoidance of
    type checking by users running on stock hardware.  To understand the role
    and necessity of special-purpose hardware for tag handling, we first
    measure the cost of type checking operations for a group of LISP programs.
    We then examine hardware and software implementations of tag operations and
    estimate the cost of tag handling with the different tag implementation
    schemes.  The data shows that minimal levels of support provide most of the
    benefits, and that tag operations can be relatively inexpensive, even when
    no special hardware support is present.",
