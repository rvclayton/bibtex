  abstract     = "This paper proposes a multimedia presentation system Harmony
    which can deal with temporal and active media such as motion video,
    computer animation, and music sounds.  Harmony is based on the notion of a
    hyperobject which integrates a hypertext system with an object-oriented
    framework.  Each object is considered a node as is usual in hypertext
    systems, and the relations between objects are represented as links between
    nodes.  Harmony extends the ordinary notion of a link.  A link in Harmony
    consists of three components: objects connected by the link, conditions
    specifying when the link is navigated, and messages sent to the target
    object.  In addition to such an extension, each object can include internal
    objects called subobjects which specify parts of an object and can become a
    source/destination of a link.  Furthermore, the notion of a group object is
    introduced to represent a synchronization of parallel displayed media
    information.  Through these extended notions of a hypertext model, temporal
    and active media can be easily handled through the description of temporal
    relations from the media in hypermedia documents.  Based on the design of
    Harmony, we have implemented a prototype multimedia presentation system
    which deals with text, music, graphics, motion video, and computer
    animation as objects.  Harmony consists of three subsystems: link manager
    subsystem (Harmony/LM), user interface subsystem (Harmony/UI), and
    object-oriented database (Harmony/DB), where a commercial object-oriented
    database was employed as the Harmony/DB.  Scenario viewer was developed for
    displaying the structure of scenario in a tree graph which can reduce a
    cognitive overhead in a hypermedia document.  The whole system was
    constructed based on C++ Language."

    WYSIWYG word processors.  In MediaView all components are manipulated this
    way.  MediaView was developed on a NeXT computer using the object-oriented
    development system called NeXTstep.  The powerful base classes defined
    there, coupled with Objective-C features like dynamic binding, enabled
    MediaView to be developed in a short time but with a rich feature set.  Two
    key subclasses of NeXTstep objects give MediaView its strengths.  Through
    them, arbitrarily complex multimedia components can be installed in a
    document and then copied and pasted, just as if they were words.  MediaView
    has two document formats --- one for compactness and speed and one for
    interchange with other applications and other computers.  The latter format
    s based on a hierarchical file system, which is well suited to UNIX but
    also to other systems, like that found on a Macintosh."

    of a set of discrete data components that are joined together in time and

    Transportable documents are those in which the document structure can be
    accessed across system environments independently of individual component
    input or output dependencies; dynamic documents are those in which the
    synchronization of document components are not staticly defined as an
    integral part of the data definition but are dynamicly defined as
    attributes of the general document structure.  The focus of this paper is
    the presentation of the basic building blocks of the CWI Multimedia
    Interchange Format (CMIF).  CMIF is used to describe the temporal and
    structural relationships that exist in multimedia documents.  In order to
    put our work in a concrete context, we start our discussion with a brief
    description of the portability requirements for documents used within the
    CWI/Multimedia Pipeline.  We then provide a layered description of our
    document structure format; this format provides a means for expressing a
    document in terms of synchronization channels, event descriptors, data
    descriptors, data blocks and synchronization arcs, each element of which
    contains a set of appropriate descriptive attributes.  The paper describes
    each of these concepts abstractly as well as in the context of a uniform
    example.  The paper concludes with a discussion of our intended future
    direction in using the various attribute descriptors to control a broad
    range of activities within the CWI/Multimedia Pipeline.",

    encompass a multitude of other descriptions.  Parsing moving image
    sequences is reduced to simply parsing the contextual information which
    forms the description.  Our approach, Stratification, also has important
    ramifications in terms of an elastic representation of moving images.
    Ambient sound can provide us with important contextual clues as to what is

    important step towards the eventual automatization of the logging
