    describes how a program is put together by means of a hierarchically
    structured collection of pictures, called formal dependency diagrams
    (FDDs).  Icons in an FDD denote a wide range of data and control
    dependencies among the relatively coarse-grained entities contained in
    large programs.  Dependencies considered atomic with respect to one level
    in a hierarchy can be decomposed into a number of dependencies at a lower
    level.  Each dependency can be a predefined primitive of the FDD language
    or it can be defined by a PegaSys user in terms of the primitives.  A
    PegsSys user is given the illusion that logical formulas do not exist, even
    though PegaSys reasons about them internally.  This involves (1) checking
    whether an FDD is meaningful syntactically, (2) determining whether
    hierarchical refinements of an FDD are methodologically sound, and (3)
    deciding whether an FDD hierarchy is logically consistent with the program
    that it is intended to describe.  The techniques used to provide these
    capabilities are discussed along with the logical properties that enable
    PegaSys to maintain the user illusion.",

    the redundancy that can be eliminated by supercompilation may be various,

    predictions must be made early in order to control the rising cost of
    missed opportunity that result from the prediction delay.  We also show
    that existing sophisticated path profiling schemes, if used in an online

    much lower runtime overheads.Based on these observation we developed a new
    low-overhead software profiling scheme for hot path prediction.  Using an
    abstract metric we compare our scheme to path profile based prediction and
    show that our scheme achieves comparable prediction quality.  In our second
    set of experiments we include runtime overhead and evaluate the performance
    of our scheme in a realistic application: Dynamo, a dynamic optimization
    system.  The results show that our prediction scheme clearly outperforms

    The performance of the interpreter is important even for high-performance

    there are advantages in delaying the start of compilation and in reducing
    the number of the target methods to be compiled.  Many techniques have been
    proposed to improve the performance of various interpreters, but none of
    them has fully addressed the issues of minimizing redundant memory accesses
    and the overhead of indirect branches inherent to interpreters running on
    superscalar processors.  These issues are especially serious for Java
    because each bytecode is typically one or a few bytes long and the
    execution routine for each bytecode is also short due to the low-level,
    stack-based semantics of Java bytecode.  In this paper, we describe three
    novel techniques of our Java bytecode interpreter, write-through
    top-of-stack caching (WT), position-based handler customization (PHC), and
    position-based speculative decoding (PSD), which ameliorate these problems

    programmers write monitoring functions assuming simple sequential execution

    monitoring functions speculatively in parallel with the main computation.
    For recovery, programmers can define fine-grain transactions whose side
    effects, including all register modifications and memory writes, can either
    be committed or aborted under program control.  Transactions are
    implemented efficiently by treating them as speculative threads.  Our
    experimental results suggest that monitored execution is more amenable to

    by a factor of 1.5 by exploiting single-thread instruction-level
    parallelism, and by an additional factor of 1.6 using thread-level
    speculation.  This results in an overall improvement of 2.5 times and a

    that used to be 2.5 times slower executes with a degradation of only 12%

    Specifically, we find three advantages to our approach.  First, SRPC
    improves the performance of distributed file servers, reducing latency by
    combining the execution of operations at the file server.  Second, SRPC
    enables the ready addition of new functionality; for example, more powerful
    cache consistency models can be realized on top of a server that exports a

    the following universal algebraic construction: Any function defined on the

    the code needed to transition from the old version to the new.  A novel
    aspect of our patches is that they consist of verifiable native code (e.g.
    Proof-Carrying Code [17] or Typed Assembly Language [16]), which is native
    code accompanied by annotations that allow on-line verification of the
    code's safety.  We discuss how patches are generated mostly automatically,
    how they are applied using dynamic-linking technology, and how code is
    compiled to make it updateable.  To concretely illustrate our system, we
    have implemented a dynamically-updateable web server, FlashEd.  We discuss

    method handles both safety and liveness properties.  It is compositional,
    i.e., a specification of a composite system can be obtained from
    specifications of its components.  Specifications are given as labeled
    transition systems with fairness properties, using a program-like notation
    with guarded multiple assignments.  Compositionality is attained by
    partitioning the labels of a transition system into input events, which
    intuitively denote message receptions, and output events, which intuitively
    denote message transmissions.  A specification denotes a set of allowed
    sequences of message transmissions and receptions, in analogy with the way
    finite automata are used as acceptors of finite strings.  A lower-level
    specification implements a higher-level one.  We present a verification
    technique which reduces the problem of verifying the correctness of an
    implementation to classical verification conditions.  Safety properties are
    verified by establishing a simulation relation between transition systems.
    Liveness properties are verified using methods for proving termination
    under fairness assumptions.  Since specifications can be given at various
    levels of abstraction, the method is suitable in a development process
    where a detailed implementation is developed from an abstract specification
    through a sequence of refinement steps.  As an application of the method,

    useful guidance for concurrency bug detection, testing, and concurrent
    programming language design.  Some of our findings are as follows: (1)
    Around one third of the examined non-deadlock concurrency bugs are caused
    by violation to programmers' order intentions, which may not be easily
    expressed via synchronization primitives like locks and transactional
    memories; (2) Around 34% of the examined non-deadlock concurrency bugs
    involve multiple variables, which are not well addressed by existing bug
    detection tools; (3) About 92% of the examined concurrency bugs can be
    reliably triggered by enforcing certain orders among no more than 4 memory
    accesses.  This indicates that testing concurrent programs can target at
    exploring possible orders among every small groups of memory accesses,
    instead of among all memory accesses; (4) About 73% of the examined
    non-deadlock concurrency bugs were not fixed by simply adding or changing

    use operational semantics in the form of abstract machines given by rewrite
    systems in which the rewrite rules operate on terms representing states of
    computations.  To construct compilers and new architectures we employ a
    particular strategy called pass separation, a form of staging
    transformation, that takes a program p and constructs a pair of programs

    operational semantics for a language, with arguments x and y denoting a
    source program and its input data, then pass separation constructs programs
    p1 and p2 corresponding to a compiler and an executor.  The compiler
    translates the source language into an intermediate-level target language,
    and the executor provides the definition for this language.  Our use of
    pass separation supports the automatic definition of target languages or
    architectures, and the structure of these architectures is directed by the
    structure of the given source semantics.  These architectures resemble
    abstract machine languages found in hand-crafted compilers.  Our method is
    restricted to a limited class of abstract machines given as term-rewriting
    systems, but we argue that this class encompasses a large set of language
    definitions derived from more natural operational semantics.  We provide

    representation is also desirable internally to economize on aspects of the
    implementation.  Consequently, Concert has an IDL as an intermediate
    language, produced by compiler front-ends and not normally manipulated by
    programmers.  It is formally separated into a contract, which defines
    interoperability and an endpoint modifier, which captures the local choice
    of representation.  Only contracts are used to define interface
    equivalence.  Our choice of what kinds of information to put in the
    contract was motivated by a desire to be minimal, thereby enabling maximum
    feasible interoperability between different expressions of the same
    abstraction in the same or different languages.",

    specific problem domain and can then state algorithms in this language.
    Thus, Scheme programmers can formulate layers of abstraction whose
    expressive power greatly surpasses that of ordinary modules.
    Unfortunately, Scheme's macros are also too powerful.  The problem is that
    macro definitions extend the parser, a component of a language's
    environment that is always supposed to terminate and produce predictable
    results, and that they can thus turn the parser into a chaotic and
    unpredictable tool.  In this paper, we report on an experiment to tame the
    power of macros.  Specifically, we introduce a system for specifying and
    restricting the class of shapes that a macro can transform.  We dub the
    revised macro system well-shaped macros.",

    produced the Alloy modeling language in order to address these issues.
    Model-checking with Alloy allows for the specification of invariants and
    the itemization of possible satisfying program executions, as well as other
    features.  One downside in the use of Alloy is that the model designer is
    required to learn another language with all its syntax and semantics,
    simply to express the model.  A more ideal situation would be to bridge the
    gap between the model designer and the modeling software with some
    understanding and processing of natural language.  The focus of this paper
    is to present a solution of natural language processing coupled with model
    design for a certain problem domain.  Based upon prior work of the author
    and his colleagues, a grammar will be presented and examined, and the
    conversion from natural language to Alloy will be discussed.  Additional
    analyses of members of the problem domain will then be presented, including
    meaningful dissection of unsatisfiable models using new additions to the
    Alloy language and mapping these results back to the original natural
    language model.  In this way, describing models is made easier with the
    added advantage of detecting and isolating unsatisfiable portions of the
    model.  The implications of this effort reveal numerous applications in the
