    the maximum speed of transmission of intelligence by telegraph.  These
    factors are signal shaping and choice of codes.  The first is concerned
    with the best wave shape to be impressed on the transmitting medium so as
    to permit of greater speed without undue interference either in the circuit
    under consideration or in those adjacent, while the latter deals with the
    choice of codes which will permit of transmitting a maxi-mum amount of
    intelligence with a given number of signal elements.  It is shown that the
    wave shape depends somewhat on the type of circuit over which intelligence
    is to be transmitted and that for most cases the optimum wave is neither
    rectangular nor a half cycle sine wave as is frequently used but a wave of
    special form produced by sending a simple rectangular wave through a
    suitable network.  The impedances usually associated with telegraph
    circuits are such as to produce a fair degree of signal shaping when a
    rectangular voltage wave is impressed.  Consideration of the choice of
    codes show that while it is desirable to use those involving more than two
    current values, there are limitations which prevent a large number of
    current values being used.  A table of comparisons shows the relative speed
    efficiencies of various codes proposed.  It is shown that no advantages
    result from the use of a sine wave for telegraph transmission as proposed
    by Squier and others and that their arguments are based on erroneous

    Unfortunately, today's internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP)
    architectures have serious problems: a full mesh iBGP configuration does
    not scale to large networks and route reflection can introduce problems
    such as protocol oscillations and persistent loops.  Instead, we argue that
    a Routing Control Platform (RCP) should collect information about external

    router in an AS.  RCP is a logically-centralized platform, separate from
    the IP forwarding plane, that performs route selection on behalf of routers
    and communicates selected routes to the routers using the unmodified iBGP
    protocol.  RCP provides scalability without sacrificing correctness.  In
    this paper, we present the design and implementation of an RCP prototype on
    commodity hardware.  Using traces of BGP and internal routing data from a
    Tier-1 backbone, we demonstrate that RCP is fast and reliable enough to
    drive the BGP routing decisions for a large network.  We show that RCP
    assigns routes correctly, even when the functionality is replicated and

    not properly synchronized.  Race conditions are often considered to be
    manifestations of bugs, since their presence can cause the program to
    behave unexpectedly.  Unfortunately, there has been little agreement in the
    literature as to precisely what constitutes a race condition.  Two
    different notions have been implicitly considered: one pertaining to
    programs intended to be deterministic (which we call general races) and the
    other to nondeterministic programs containing critical sections (which we
    call data races).  However, the differences between general races and data
    races have not yet been recognized.  This paper examines these differences
    by characterizing races using a formal model and exploring their
    properties.  We show that two variations of each type of race exist:
    feasible general races and data races capture the intuitive notions desired
    for debugging and apparent races capture less accurate notions implicitly
    assumed by most dynamic race detection methods.  We also show that locating
    feasible races is an NP-hard problem, implying that only the apparent
    races, which are approximations to feasible races, can be detected in
    practice.  The complexity of dynamically locating apparent races depends on
    the type of synchronization used by the program.  Apparent races can be
    exhaustively located efficiently only for weak types of synchronization
    that are incapable of implementing mutual exclusion.  This result has
    important implications since we argue that debugging general races requires
    exhaustive race detection and is inherently harder than debugging data
    races (which requires only partial race detection).  Programs containing
    data races can therefore be efficiently debugged by locating certain easily
    identifiable races.  In contrast, programs containing general races require
    more complex debugging techniques.",

    article surveys research progress made to address various coverage problems
    in sensor networks.  We first provide discussions on sensor coverage models
    and design issues.  The coverage problems in sensor networks can be
    classified into three categories according to the subject to be covered.
    We state the basic coverage problems in each category, and review
    representative solution approaches in the literature.  We also provide

    of the top 100 mature products on Sourceforge, I find a few surprising
    things.  First, most OSS programs are developed by individuals, rather than
    communities.  The median number of developers in the 100 projects I looked
    at was 4 and the mode was 1 - numbers much lower than previous numbers
    reported for highly successful projects! Second, most OSS programs do not
    generate a lot of discussion.  Third, products with more developers tend to
    be viewed and downloaded more often.  Fourth, the number of developers

    model had been published in 1984, this was in accordance with ISO practice
    of reviewing and revising standards every five years, and there was good
    reason for considering the task.  Over the intervening five years, the
    groups developing the OSI protocols had raised many questions about the
    architecture and these had been answered and documented in the Approved
    Commentaries [1994].  Many of these commentaries contained information that
    could be usefully incorporated into the Reference Model itself.  In
    addition, the addendum describing connectionless mode, i.e.  datagrams, had
    been completed several years before and needed to be incorporated.  There
    was also considerable demand for interworking connection-mode and
    connectionless mode communication, something not supported by the Reference
    Model or any architecture.  Also, when the original version of the
    Reference Model was frozen about 1983 some aspects of OSI such as the upper
    layers were not well understood and were only described in the most cursory
    manner.  And while connection-mode and connectionless mode had been brought
    within OSI, there was no indication as to how broadcast and multicast were
    to be handled.  Thus, the revision might be able to provide a more

    popular in social studies of science [2]–[4].  In support of his argument
    Gould presented the case of Samuel George Morton, a 19th-century physician
    and physical anthropologist famous for his measurements of human skulls.
    Morton was considered the objectivist of his era, but Gould reanalyzed
    Morton's data and in his prize-winning book The Mismeasure of Man [5]
    argued that Morton skewed his data to fit his preconceptions about human
    variation.  Morton is now viewed as a canonical example of scientific
    misconduct.  But did Morton really fudge his data? Are studies of human
    variation inevitably biased, as per Gould, or are objective accounts
    attainable, as Morton attempted? We investigated these questions by
    remeasuring Morton's skulls and reexamining both Morton's and Gould's
    analyses.  Our results resolve this historical controversy, demonstrating
    that Morton did not manipulate data to support his preconceptions, contra

    timescales over which such new control architectures can be introduced
    might vary from, for example, a video conferencing specific control
    architecture, which is active only for the duration of the conference, to a
    new version of a general purpose control architecture, which might be

    refinement of services at a finer level of granularity by means of the
    connection closure concept.  In this case modification of services can be
    performed at an application-specific level.  These attributes of the
    Tempest framework allows service providers to effectively become network
    operators for some well defined partition of the physical network.  This
    enables them to take advantage of the knowledge they possess about how the
    network resources are to be used, by programming their own specially

    looks up the real names of people in a database of BTL UNIX users, and
    sends mail appropriately .  The most specific kind of address is of the
    form "ruby.jane.elliott-mh-1273" but everything except "elliott" is
    optional.  When someone has no computer address, the mail is routed to a
    nearby clerk, with appropriate labels so that the mail need merely be
    printed and then put in the company mail.  If the eventual address is not
    only non-electronic but outside the company (e.g.  at AT&T) the mail is
    routed to a clerk near the sender and addressed for the U.S.  Mail.  The
    names, room numbers, and department numbers of all employees are updated
    automatically from the standard company files; user ids can be updated by
    the users themselves, simply by sending the appropriate electronic mail.  A
    line of the form "UPDATE: research!mel IS michael.e.lesk-mh-1274" mailed to
    `postoffice`!mailroom will update the appropriate listing.  As with other
    data bases, there is the usual choice between distributing the database or
    routing all queries to a single site.  The post command may be used with
    local directories of users, or all mail may be sent to a central site which
    has a phone book and then the central site can route and deliver the
