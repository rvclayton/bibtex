    the maximum speed of transmission of intelligence by telegraph.  These
    factors are signal shaping and choice of codes.  The first is concerned
    with the best wave shape to be impressed on the transmitting medium so as
    to permit of greater speed without undue interference either in the circuit
    under consideration or in those adjacent, while the latter deals with the
    choice of codes which will permit of transmitting a maxi-mum amount of
    intelligence with a given number of signal elements.  It is shown that the
    wave shape depends somewhat on the type of circuit over which intelligence
    is to be transmitted and that for most cases the optimum wave is neither
    rectangular nor a half cycle sine wave as is frequently used but a wave of
    special form produced by sending a simple rectangular wave through a
    suitable network.  The impedances usually associated with telegraph
    circuits are such as to produce a fair degree of signal shaping when a
    rectangular voltage wave is impressed.  Consideration of the choice of
    codes show that while it is desirable to use those involving more than two
    current values, there are limitations which prevent a large number of
    current values being used.  A table of comparisons shows the relative speed
    efficiencies of various codes proposed.  It is shown that no advantages
    result from the use of a sine wave for telegraph transmission as proposed
    by Squier and others and that their arguments are based on erroneous
    assumptions.",

    giving an algorithm that is much simpler with vastly easier analysis.  For

    synchronization, race conditions result when accesses to shared memory are
    not properly synchronized.  Race conditions are often considered to be
    manifestations of bugs, since their presence can cause the program to
    behave unexpectedly.  Unfortunately, there has been little agreement in the
    literature as to precisely what constitutes a race condition.  Two
    different notions have been implicitly considered: one pertaining to
    programs intended to be deterministic (which we call general races) and the
    other to nondeterministic programs containing critical sections (which we
    call data races).  However, the differences between general races and data
    races have not yet been recognized.  This paper examines these differences
    by characterizing races using a formal model and exploring their
    properties.  We show that two variations of each type of race exist:
    feasible general races and data races capture the intuitive notions desired
    for debugging and apparent races capture less accurate notions implicitly
    assumed by most dynamic race detection methods.  We also show that locating
    feasible races is an NP-hard problem, implying that only the apparent
    races, which are approximations to feasible races, can be detected in
    practice.  The complexity of dynamically locating apparent races depends on
    the type of synchronization used by the program.  Apparent races can be
    exhaustively located efficiently only for weak types of synchronization
    that are incapable of implementing mutual exclusion.  This result has
    important implications since we argue that debugging general races requires
    exhaustive race detection and is inherently harder than debugging data
    races (which requires only partial race detection).  Programs containing
    data races can therefore be efficiently debugged by locating certain easily
    identifiable races.  In contrast, programs containing general races require
    more complex debugging techniques.",

    etc.  Coverage which is one of the most important performance metrics for
    sensor networks reflects how well a sensor field is monitored.  Individual
    sensor coverage models are dependent on the sensing functions of different
    types of sensors, while network-wide sensing coverage is a collective
    performance measure for geographically distributed sensor nodes.  This
    article surveys research progress made to address various coverage problems
    in sensor networks.  We first provide discussions on sensor coverage models
    and design issues.  The coverage problems in sensor networks can be
    classified into three categories according to the subject to be covered.
    We state the basic coverage problems in each category, and review
    representative solution approaches in the literature.  We also provide
    comments and discussions on some extensions and variants of these basic
    coverage problems.",

    Cathedral and the Bazaar, open-source software (OSS) has commonly been
    regarded as work produced by a community of developers.  Yet, given the
    nature of software programs, one also hears of developers with no lives
    that work very hard to achieve great product results.  In this paper, I
    sought empirical evidence that would help us understand which is more
    common - the cave (i.e., lone producer) or the community.  Based on a study
    of the top 100 mature products on Sourceforge, I find a few surprising
    things.  First, most OSS programs are developed by individuals, rather than
    communities.  The median number of developers in the 100 projects I looked
    at was 4 and the mode was 1 - numbers much lower than previous numbers
    reported for highly successful projects! Second, most OSS programs do not
    generate a lot of discussion.  Third, products with more developers tend to
    be viewed and downloaded more often.  Fourth, the number of developers
    associated with a project was positively correlated to the age of the
    project.  Fifth, the larger the project, the smaller the percent of project
    administrators.",

  abstract     = {Electronic mail at Bell Labs is usually routed to a system
    and a user-id.  There are now over 100 BTL UNIX systems connected by the
    UUCP network, and it is more and more of a nuisance to remember where your
    correspondents log in and what user-id they use.  The new utility post
    looks up the real names of people in a database of BTL UNIX users, and
    sends mail appropriately .  The most specific kind of address is of the
    form "ruby.jane.elliott-mh-1273" but everything except "elliott" is
    optional.  When someone has no computer address, the mail is routed to a
    nearby clerk, with appropriate labels so that the mail need merely be
    printed and then put in the company mail.  If the eventual address is not
    only non-electronic but outside the company (e.g.  at AT&T) the mail is
    routed to a clerk near the sender and addressed for the U.S.  Mail.  The
    names, room numbers, and department numbers of all employees are updated
    automatically from the standard company files; user ids can be updated by
    the users themselves, simply by sending the appropriate electronic mail.  A
    line of the form "UPDATE: research!mel IS michael.e.lesk-mh-1274" mailed to
    `postoffice`!mailroom will update the appropriate listing.  As with other
    data bases, there is the usual choice between distributing the database or
    routing all queries to a single site.  The post command may be used with
    local directories of users, or all mail may be sent to a central site which
    has a phone book and then the central site can route and deliver the
    message.  In addition, it is possible to route some mail locally and then
    forward other mail to the central site.  The individual user may also have
    a directory of abbreviations; thus the directory is really a hierarchy of
    directories running through personal directories, local site directories,
    and finally large central directories.},
