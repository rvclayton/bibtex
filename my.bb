    operations that are both buggy and im-precise.  We have developed Hoist: a

    abstract operations using a microprocessor (or simulator) as its own
    specification.  With almost no input from a human, Hoist generates a
    collection of C functions ready to be linked into an abstract interpreter.
    We demonstrate that Hoist generates abstract operations that are correct,
    having been extensively tested, sufficiently fast, and substantially more
    precise than manually written abstract operations. Hoist is currently
    limited to eight-bit machines due to costs exponential in the word size of
    the target architecture.  It is essential to be able to analyze software
    running on these small processors: they are important and ubiquitous, with
    many embedded and safety-critical systems being based on them.",

    exploiting a processor's multithreading capability to run ``assist''
    threads.  Previous experiments on hyper-threaded processors have
    demonstrated significant speedups by using helper threads to prefetch
    hard-to-predict delinquent data accesses.  In order to apply this technique
    to processors that do not have built-in hardware support for
    multithreading, we introduce virtual multithreading (VMT), a novel form of
    switch-on-event user-level multithreading, capable of fly-weight
    multiplexing of event-driven thread executions on a single processor
    without additional operating system support.  The compiler plays a key role
    in minimizing synchronization cost by judiciously partitioning register
    usage among the user-level threads.  The VMT approach makes it possible to
    launch dynamic helper thread instances in response to long-latency cache
    miss events, and to run helper threads in the shadow of cache misses when
    the main thread would be otherwise stalled.The concept of VMT is prototyped
    on an Itanium Â® 2 processor using features provided by the Processor
    Abstraction Layer (PAL) firmware mechanism already present in currently
    shipping processors.  On a 4-way MP physical system equipped with
    VMT-enabled Itanium 2 processors, helper threading via the VMT mechanism
    can achieve significant performance gains for a diverse set of real-world
    workloads, ranging from single-threaded workstation benchmarks to heavily
    multithreaded large scale decision support systems (DSS) using the IBM DB2
    Universal Database.  We measure a wall-clock speedup of 5.8% to 38.5% for
    the workstation benchmarks, and 5.0% to 12.7% on DSS workload queries.",

    overhead (â¹10% in most cases and often less than 5%), it can be used to
    track leaks in production code that take days to manifest.  In addition to
    identifying the allocations that leak memory, SWAT exposes where the
    program last accessed the leaked data, which facilitates debugging and
    fixing the leak.  SWAT has been used by several product groups at Microsoft

    phase prediction is unique because it uses locality profiles, and it marks
    phase boundaries in program code.  The second half of the paper presents a
    comprehensive evaluation.  It measures the accuracy and the coverage of the
    new technique and compares it with best known run-time methods.  It

    dynamically tracking MRC at run time is challenging in systems with virtual

    second method is an OS-only implementation that can track MRC at coarse

    allocation for multiprogramming systems and memory energy management.  Our
    real system experiments on Linux with applications including Apache Web
    Server show that the MRC-directed memory allocation can speed up the
    applications' execution/response time by up to a factor of 5.86 and reduce
    the number of page faults by up to 63.1%.  Our execution-driven simulation

    typically from an invalid cache line, permitting the processor to compute
    with incoherent data.  In parallel, the coherence protocol obtains the
    necessary coherence permissions and the correct value.  Eventually, the
    speculative use of the incoherent data can be verified against the coherent
    data.  Thus, coherence decoupling can greatly reduce --- if not eliminate
    --- the effects of false sharing.  Furthermore, coherence decoupling can
    also reduce latencies incurred by true sharing.  SCL protocols reduce those
    latencies by speculatively writing updates into invalid lines, thereby
    increasing the accuracy of speculation, without complicating the simple,
    underlying coherence protocol that guarantees correctness.The performance
    benefits of coherence decoupling are evaluated using a full-system

    work-conserving, i.e., they schedule a request as soon as the previous
    request has finished.  Such schedulers often require multiple outstanding
    requests from each process to meet system-level goals of performance and
    quality of service.  Unfortunately, many common applications issue disk
    read requests in a synchronous manner, interspersing successive requests
    with short periods of computation.  The scheduler chooses the next request
    too early; this induces deceptive idleness, a condition where the scheduler
    incorrectly assumes that the last request issuing process has no further
    requests, and becomes forced to switch to a request from another process.We
    propose the anticipatory disk scheduling framework to solve this problem in
    a simple, general and transparent way, based on the non-work-conserving
    scheduling discipline.  Our FreeBSD implementation is observed to yield
    large benefits on a range of microbenchmarks and real workloads.  The
    Apache webserver delivers between 29% and 71% more throughput on a

    allows distributed Internet applications to detect and recover from path
    outages and periods of degraded performance within several seconds,
    improving over today's wide-area routing protocols that take at least
    several minutes to recover.  A RON is an application-layer overlay on top
    of the existing Internet routing substrate.  The RON nodes monitor the
    functioning and quality of the Internet paths among themselves, and use
    this information to decide whether to route packets directly over the
    Internet or by way of other RON nodes, optimizing application-specific
    routing metrics.Results from two sets of measurements of a working RON
    deployed at sites scattered across the Internet demonstrate the benefits of
    our architecture.  For instance, over a 64-hour sampling period in March
    2001 across a twelve-node RON, there were 32 significant outages, each
    lasting over thirty minutes, over the 132 measured paths.  RON's routing
    mechanism was able to detect, recover, and route around all of them, in
    less than twenty seconds on average, showing that its methods for fault
    detection and recovery work well at discovering alternate paths in the
    Internet.  Furthermore, RON was able to improve the loss rate, latency, or
    throughput perceived by data transfers; for example, about 5% of the
    transfers doubled their TCP throughput and 5% of our transfers saw their
    loss probability reduced by 0.05.  We found that forwarding packets via at
    most one intermediate RON node is sufficient to overcome faults and improve
    performance in most cases.  These improvements, particularly in the area of
    fault detection and recovery, demonstrate the benefits of moving some of
    the control over routing into the hands of end-systems.",

    resource prices to balance supply and demand, allocating resources to their
    most efficient use.  A reconfigurable server switching infrastructure

    the available battery life.  Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) has been a key

    demonstrates techniques that automatically extract such checking
    information from the source code itself, rather than the programmer,
    thereby avoiding the need for a priori knowledge of system rules.The
    cornerstone of our approach is inferring programmer 'beliefs' that we then
    cross-check for contradictions.  Beliefs are facts implied by code: a
    dereference of a pointer, p, implies a belief that p is non-null, a call to
    'unlock(1)' implies that 1 was locked, etc.  For beliefs we know the
    programmer must hold, such as the pointer dereference above, we immediately
    flag contradictions as errors.  For beliefs that the programmer may hold,
    we can assume these beliefs hold and use a statistical analysis to rank the
    resulting errors from most to least likely.  For example, a call to
    'spin_lock' followed once by a call to 'spin_unlock' implies that the
    programmer may have paired these calls by coincidence.  If the pairing
    happens 999 out of 1000 times, though, then it is probably a valid belief
    and the sole deviation a probable error.  The key feature of this approach
    is that it requires no a priori knowledge of truth: if two beliefs
    contradict, we know that one is an error without knowing what the correct
    belief is.Conceptually, our checkers extract beliefs by tailoring rule
    'templates' to a system --- for example, finding all functions that fit the
    rule template 'a must be paired with b.' We have developed six checkers
    that follow this conceptual framework.  They find hundreds of bugs in real
    systems such as Linux and OpenBSD.  From our experience, they give a
    dramatic reduction in the manual effort needed to check a large system.
    Compared to our previous work [9], these template checkers find ten to one
    hundred times more rule instances and derive properties we found

    For example, we can detect a code segment that includes additional code

    approach based on the Java Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that is part of the
    J9 Java Virtual Machine, and we supported several important idioms for
    special hardware-assist instructions on the IBM zSeries and on some models
    of the IBM pSeries.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, we
    performed two experiments.  The first one is to see how many more patterns
    we can detect compared to the previous approach.  The second one is to see

    Thus programmers can develop and test transactional programs in existing
    systems today, and can enjoy the performance benefits of HTM support when
    it becomes available.We describe our prototype HyTM system, comprising a
    compiler and a library.  The compiler allows a transaction to be attempted
    using best-effort HTM, and retried using the software library if it fails.
    We have used our prototype to 'transactify' part of the Berkeley DB system,
    as well as several benchmarks.  By disabling the optional use of HTM, we
    can run all of these tests on existing systems.  Furthermore, by using a

    atomicity violations, which will soon become increasingly important due to
    the emerging trend of transactional memory models.This paper proposes an
    innovative, comprehensive, invariantbased approach called AVIO to detect
    atomicity violations.  Our idea is based on a novel observation called
    access interleaving invariant, which is a good indication of programmers'
    assumptions about the atomicity of certain code regions.  By automatically
    extracting such invariants and detecting violations of these invariants at
    run time, AVIO can detect a variety of atomicity violations.Based on this
    idea, we have designed and built two implementations of AVIO and evaluated
    the trade-offs between them.  The first implementation, AVIO-S, is purely
    in software, while the second, AVIO-H, requires some simple extensions to
    the cache coherence hardware.  AVIO-S is cheaper and more accurate but
    incurs much higher overhead and thus more run-time perturbation than AVIOH.
    Therefore, AVIO-S is more suitable for in-house bug detection and
    postmortem bug diagnosis, while AVIO-H can be used for bug detection during
    production runs.We evaluate both implementations of AVIO using large
    realworld server applications (Apache and MySQL) with six representative
    real atomicity violation bugs, and SPLASH-2 benchmarks.  Our results show
    that AVIO detects more tested atomicity violations of various types and has

    (Bell), a statistical approach that encodes per-object sites to a single

    objects that use the site and a known, finite set of possible sites, Bell
    uses brute-force decoding to recover the site with high accuracy.We use

    during periods of poor single-thread performance.  (ii) ReStore does not
    explicitly duplicate instructions and instead exploits mispredictions among
    highly confident branch predictions as symptoms of faults.  (iii)
    Slipstream creates a reduced alternate thread by replacing many
    instructions with highly confident predictions.  We explore PRT as a
    possible direction for achieving the fault tolerance of full duplication
    with the performance of single-thread execution.  Opportunistic and ReStore
    yield partial coverage since they are restricted to using only partial
    duplication or only confident predictions, respectively.  Previous analysis
    of Slipstream fault tolerance was cursory and concluded that only
    duplicated instructions are covered.  In this paper, we attempt to better
    understand Slipstream's fault tolerance, conjecturing that the mixture of
    partial duplication and confident predictions actually closely approximates
    the coverage of full duplication.  A thorough dissection of prediction
    scenarios confirms that faults in nearly 100% of instructions are
    detectable.  Fewer than 0.1% of faulty instructions are not detectable due
    to coincident faults and mispredictions.  Next we show that the current
    recovery implementation fails to leverage excellent detection capability,
    since recovery sometimes initiates belatedly, after already retiring a
    detected faulty instruction.  We propose and evaluate a suite of simple
    microarchitectural alterations to recovery and checking.  Using the best
    alterations, Slipstream can recover from faults in 99% of instructions,
    compared to only 78% of instructions without alterations.  Both results are
    much higher than predicted by past research, which claims coverage for only
    duplicated instructions, or 65% of instructions.  On an 8-issue SMT
    processor, Slipstream performs within 1.3% of single-thread execution
    whereas full duplication slows performance by 14%.A key byproduct of this
    paper is a novel analysis framework in which every dynamic instruction is
    considered to be hypothetically faulty, thus not requiring explicit fault
    injection.  Fault coverage is measured in terms of the fraction of
    candidate faulty instructions that are directly or indirectly detectable

    redundant threading by bringing together the concepts of slice-level
    execution and value and control-flow locality into a novel partial
    redundant threading mechanism called SlicK.The purpose of redundant
    execution is to check the integrity of the outputs propagating out of the
    core (typically through stores).  SlicK implements redundancy at the
    granularity of backward-slices of these output instructions and exploits
    value and control-flow locality to avoid redundantly executing slices that
    lead to predictable outputs, thereby avoiding redundant execution of a
    significant fraction of instructions while maintaining extremely low
    vulnerabilities for critical processor structures.We propose the
    microarchitecture of a backward-slice extractor called SliceEM that is able
    to identify backward slices without interrupting the instruction flow, and
    show how this extractor and a set of predictors can be integrated into a
    redundant threading mechanism to form SlicK.  Detailed simulations with

    intricacies of the Gregorian calendar (leap years, different number of days

    malware behavior often does not follow a linear timetable; and 2) that an

    current results are promising in that with simple symbolic execution we are
    able to discover predicates on the day of the month for four real worms.

    sharing and protection.  On one hand, Java's ability to run different
    protection domains in a single virtual machine enables domains to share
    data easily and communicate without address space switches.  On the other
    hand, unrestricted sharing blurs the boundaries between protection domains,
    making it difficult to terminate domains and enforce restrictions on
    resource usage.  Existing solutions to these problems restrict sharing in
    an ad-hoc fashion, ruling out many desirable programming styles.This paper
    presents an extension to Java's type system that systematically addresses
    the issues of data sharing, revocation, thread control, and resource
    control.  Multiple tasks running in a single virtual machines share data
    using special remote pointers, which have different types from local
    pointers.  The distinction between local and remote pointers allows the
    Java runtime system to mediate the communication between tasks without
    slowing down operations on ordinary pointers.  The extensions to Java are
    implemented by a system called Luna, based on the Guavac and Marmot
    compilers, extended with special optimizations to support both fast
    inter-task communication and dynamic access control.  The paper describes

    is hardware state, so it includes the entire operating system as well as
    applications and running processes.We have chosen to move x86 computer
    states because x86 computers are common, cheap, run the software we use,
    and have tools for migration.  Unfortunately, x86 capsules can be large,
    containing hundreds of megabytes of memory and gigabytes of disk data.  We
    have developed techniques to reduce the amount of data sent over the
    network: copy-on-write disks track just the updates to capsule disks,
    'ballooning' zeros unused memory, demand paging fetches only needed blocks,
    and hashing avoids sending blocks that already exist at the remote end.  We
    demonstrate these optimizations in a prototype system that uses VMware GSX
    Server virtual, machine monitor to create and run x86 capsules.  The system
    targets networks as slow as 384 kbps.Our experimental results suggest that
    efficient capsule migration can improve user mobility and system
    management.  Software updates or installations on a set of machines can be
    accomplished simply by distributing a capsule with the new changes.
    Assuming the presence of a prior capsule, the amount of traffic incurred is
    commensurate with the size of the update or installation package itself.
    Capsule migration makes it possible for machines to start running an
    application within 20 minutes on a 384 kbps link, without having to first
    install the application or even the underlying operating system.
    Furthermore, users' capsules can be migrated during a commute between home

    accurate estimate of application resource needs by profiling applications

    application components onto shared nodes.  By overbooking cluster resources
    in a controlled fashion, our platform can provide performance guarantees to

    commonly used QoS resource allocation mechanisms to provide application
    isolation and performance guarantees at run-time.  When compared to
    provisioning based on the worst-case, the efficiency (and consequently
    revenue) benefits from controlled overbooking of resources can be dramatic.
    Specifically, experiments on our Linux cluster implementation indicate that
    overbooking resources by as little as 1% can increase the utilization of

    cooperative I/O that can be used by energy-aware applications.  We assume
    devices which can be set to low-power operation modes if they are not

    devices with rotating components or network devices consuming energy for
    the establishment and shutdown of network connections.  In these cases

    specifying a time-out and a cancel flag.  This information enables the
    operating system to delay and batch requests so that the number of power
    mode switches is reduced and the device can be kept longer in a low-power
    mode.  We have deployed our concept to the IDE hard disk driver and Ext2
    file system of Linux and to typical real-life programs so that they make

    Vertigo makes its decisions automatically, without any application-specific

    used for controlling the processor's performance.  The algorithms operate

    conventional interval-based algorithms like LongRun, Vertigo is successful
    at focusing in on a small range of performance levels that are sufficient

    [4] is an effective way to find such subtle errors.  It takes a simplified
    description of the code and exhaustively tests it on all inputs, using
    techniques to explore vast state spaces efficiently.  Unfortunately, while
    model checking systems code would be wonderful, it is almost never done in
    practice: building models is just too hard.  It can take significantly more
    time to write a model than it did to write the code.  Furthermore, by
    checking an abstraction of the code rather than the code itself, it is easy
    to miss errors.The paper's first contribution is a new model checker, CMC,
    which checks C and C++ implementations directly, eliminating the need for a
    separate abstract description of the system behavior.  This has two major
    advantages: it reduces the effort to use model checking, and it reduces
    missed errors as well as time-wasting false error reports resulting from
    inconsistencies between the abstract description and the actual
    implementation.  In addition, changes in the implementation can be checked
    immediately without updating a high-level description.The paper's second
    contribution is demonstrating that CMC works well on real code by applying
    it to three implementations of the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV)
    networking protocol [7].  We found 34 distinct errors (roughly one bug per

They contain subtle race conditions that make them difficult to debug using traditional debugging techniques.  The problem is further compounded by the lack of debugging support on the devices.  This is a serious problem because the device firmware is trusted by the operating system.Model checkers are designed to systematically verify properties of concurrent systems.  Therefore, model checking is a promising approach to debugging device firmware.  However, model checking involves an exponential search.  Consequently, the models have to be small to allow effective model checking.This paper describes the abstraction techniques used by the ESP compiler to extract abstract models from device firmware written in ESP.  The abstract models are small because they discard some of the details in the firmware that is irrelevant to the particular property being verified.  The programmer is required to specify the abstractions to be performed.  The ESP compiler uses the abstraction specification to extract models conservatively.  Therefore, every bug in the original program will be present in the extracted model.This paper also presents our experience with using Spin model checker to develop and debug VMMC firmware for the Myrinet network interfaces.  An earlier version of the ESP compiler yielded models that were too large to check for system-wide properties like absence of deadlocks.  The new version of the compiler generated abstract models that were used to identify several subtle bugs in the firmware.  So far, we have not encountered any bugs that were not caught by Spin.",

  abstract     = " The quality of high-level synthesis results is strongly
    dependant on the concurrency that can be found in designs.  In this paper
    we introduce the ephemeral history register (EHR), a new primitive state
    element that enables concurrent scheduling of arbitrary rules in a
    rule-based design framework.  The key properties of the EHR are that it
    allows multiple operations to write to the same state simultaneously, and
    that the EHR maintains a history of all writes that occur within a
    clock-cycle.  Using the EHR, we present an algorithm that takes as input a
    design and a desired schedule, and produces a functionally equivalent
    design that satisfies the desired concurrency and ordering of operations.
    A processor pipeline is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the EHR and
    scheduling algorithm, and shows how this approach significantly improves on
    previous synthesis algorithms for rule-based designs.",
