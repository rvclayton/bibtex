    competition has forced companies to focus on tailoring technological
    products to meet customer preferences in user interface design, usability,
    and appearance.  Often, implementing new features has assumed less
    importance than creating an optimal product variation for different
    customer segments in international markets.  Modern computer-based systems
    result from a multidomain development process, and organizing this work
    requires developers to communicate, cooperate, and coordinate effectively
    with nonengineering teams.  Early linking of product development to other
    company operations supports this activity.Geographically dispersed
    development teams must communicate and coordinate effectively.  Distance
    and time differences provide the first obstacles, but businesses also must
    overcome linguistic and cultural challenges.  Extending the use of

    Such tasks require working at high levels of abstraction to build systems

    different aspects of the same component.  Designers of traditional
    computer-based systems usually rely on component- based techniques that

    the component-- centered approach, treating structural decomposition as a
    single model in the overall hierarchy.  Model-centered semantics and
    languages let designers concentrate on the data, computation, or
    communication models that describe complex computer-based SoC requirements.
    Appropriate design semantics specify each system aspect, and the designer
    assembles those aspects into models to define complete systems and
    components.  The developers of Rosetta, a heterogeneous systems-level
    modeling language that supports predictive design analysis, have identified
    mechanisms for defining and composing models that specify multiple domains
    of interest from many perspectives.  Rosetta requirements and domains
    define test cases and generate abstract vectors for each test scenario.

    An engineer or programmer must still set up hypotheses to use in

    approach to debugging.  Delta Debugging uses the results of automated

    Programmers supply a test function for each bug and hardcode it into any

    feeds that information to the Delta Debugging code.  As we discover more

    debugging onto machines.  Debugging can be just as disciplined, systematic,

    the coding phase, gives software engineers the comprehensive knowledge they
    need to enhance software quality and supports early detection and
    resolution of quality problems.  The integration of product and process

    decades, but Simics supports more of these possibilities within a single
    framework than other tools do.Simics is a platform for full system
    simulation that can run actual firmware and completely unmodified kernel
    and driver code.  It is sufficiently abstract to achieve tolerable
    performance levels, and it provides both functional accuracy for running
    commercial workloads and sufficient timing accuracy to interface to
    detailed hardware models.  Simics can also run a heterogeneous network of
    systems from different vendors within the same framework.  Exceptionally
    fast, Simics can easily add new components and leverage older ones within a
    practical abstraction level.  It offers a platform with a rich API and a
    powerful scripting environment for use in a broad range of applications.",

    shared-memory systems using processors that aggressively exploited
    instruction-level parallelism (ILP), including the MIPS R10000,
    Hewlett-Packard PA8000, and Intel Pentium Pro.  These processors could
    potentially reduce memory read stalls by over-lapping read latency with
    other operations, possibly changing the nature of performance bottlenecks
    in the system.The authors' experience with Rsim demonstrates that modeling
    ILP features is important even in shared-memory multiprocessor systems.  In
    particular, current simple processor-based approximations cannot model
    significant performance effects for applications exhibiting parallel read
    misses.  Further, recent shared-memory designs such as aggressive
    implementations of sequential consistency use the aggressive ILP-enhancing
    features of modern processors that simple processor-based simulators do not
    model.As microprocessor systems become more complex, the availability of
    shared infrastructure source code is likely to become increasingly crucial.
    The authors plan to release a new Rsim version shortly that will include
    instruction caches, TLBs, multimedia extensions, simultaneous
    multithreading, Rabbit fast simulation mode, and ports to Linux

    room for improvement over the auto-vectorization capabilities of current
    production compilers through careful vector-code synthesis that utilizes a
    variety of loop transformations (e.g., unroll-and-jam, interchange, etc.).
    As the set of transformations considered is increased, the selection of the
    most effective combination of transformations becomes a significant
    challenge: Currently used cost models in vectorizing compilers are often
    unable to identify the best choices.  In this paper, we address this
    problem using machine learning models to predict the performance of SIMD
    codes.  In contrast to existing approaches that have used high-level
    features of the program, we develop machine learning models based on
    features extracted from the generated assembly code.  The models are
    trained offline on a number of benchmarks and used at compile-time to
    discriminate between numerous possible vectorized variants generated from
    the input code.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine learning
    model by using it to guide automatic vectorization on a variety of tensor
    contraction kernels, with improvements ranging from 2× to 8× over Intel
    ICC's auto-vectorized code.  We also evaluate the effectiveness of the
    model on a number of stencil computations and show good improvement over

    computer-based applications such as databases and expert systems by using
    natural spoken language.  The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be
    traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with
    developing conversational interfaces.  However, it is only within the last
    decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale
    working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into
    commercial environments.  As a result many major telecommunications and
    software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue
    technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as
    computer-telephony integration.  Voice portals, which provide a
    speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are
    the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology.  This article
    describes the main components of the technology---speech recognition,
    language understanding, dialogue management, communication with an external
    source such as a database, language generation, speech synthesis---and
    shows how these component technologies can be integrated into a spoken
    dialogue system.  The article describes in detail the methods that have
    been adopted in some well-known dialogue systems, explores different system
    architectures, considers issues of specification, design, and evaluation,
    reviews some currently available dialogue development toolkits, and
    outlines prospects for future development.",

    that appears to subsume the implemented algorithm and uses type variables

    the analysis is that allowing a variable to occur both “ordinarily” and
    “weakly” in a type permits a simpler and more flexible formulation of the
    typing rules.  In particular, we are able to treat applications of
    polymorphic functions to imperative arguments with greater flexibility than
    SML–NJ.  The soundness of the type system is proved for imperative code
    using operational semantics, by showing that evaluation preserves
    typability.  By incorporating assumptions about memory addresses in the

    goal of seamless integration in the language, the system exploits the use
    of pickling to transmit arguments and return values and also exploits

    it without breaking something are poor.  Often, a fundamental
    misunderstanding of software configuration management (SCM) as it applies
    to real-world application development is at fault.  Branching is integral
    to version management, software build correctness, and release management.
    Good decisions about when and why to branch can make it much easier for
    developers and release engineers to coordinate software product changes.
    The right branching strategy makes it easier to deliver the right code,
    re-create past releases, and--if necessary--roll back to a previous
    release.  Adopting the right SCM branching model facilitates rapid
    development, increases overall product quality and process efficiency,
    reduces the incidence of software failures, and improves organizational

    transmission or storage, to be used later in reconstituting an equivalent
    object.  This is accomplished by a mechanism known as pickling [Binel et
    al. 1987; Binell et al. 1994; Herlihy & Liskov 19821.  Pickling is the
    process of creating a serialized representation of objects.  Pickling
    defines the serialized form to include meta information that identifies the
    type of each object and the relationships between objects within a stream.
    Values and types are serialized with enough information to insure that the
    equivalent typed object and the objects to which it refers can be
    recreated.  Unpickling is the complementary process of recreating objects
    from the serialized representation.  Pickling and unpickling extract from
    the Java Virtual machine, at runtime, any meta information needed to pickle
    the fields of objects.  Class specific methods are only required to
    customize the pickling process.",

    hash table technologies have offered at most two of these three.  Moreover,
    these hash tables do no dynamic memory allocation (except when the tables
    have to be resized), are easy to code, admit efficient concurrent
    implementations, and can be tuned (even dynamically).  This is enabled by
    one simple idea: allow elements in the hash table to have multiple
    potential locations by using multiple hash functions, and allow elements to
    be relocated among potential locations to make room for new elements.  Such
    relocations can cascade, inducing as earch-tree to find an empty slot, and
    a sequence of relocations to allow the insertion of a new key.",

    a pointer variant that has more functionality than is provided by the
    basic, language-defined pointer.  For example, type-accurate garbage
    collection, reference counting, or transparent references to distributed or
    persistent objects, might be implemented with classes that provide pointer
    functionality.  The C++ language directly supports one kind of pointer
    substitute,the smart pointer, in the form of overloadable indirection
    operators: -> and * .  In this paper we evaluate how seamlessly smart
    pointers can replace raw pointers.  The ideal is for client code not to
    care whether it is using raw pointers or smart pointers.  For example, if a
    typedef selects whether raw or smart pointers are used throughout the
    program, changing the value of the typedef should not introduce syntax
    errors.  Unfortunately, C++ does not support pointer substitutes well
    enough to permit seamless integration.  This paper presents the desired
    behavior of smart pointers in terms of the semantics of raw pointers that
    the smart pointers try to emulate.  Then,we describe several ways of
    implementing smart pointers.  For each, we show cases in which the
    smart-pointers fail to behave like raw pointers.  From among the choices,
    we explain which is the best for emulating the standard pointer
    conversions.  Accessors are similar to smart pointers, but have certain
    advantages.  This paper discusses the differences between accessors and
    smart pointers, and shows why our conclusions about type conversion
    behavior also apply to accessors.  Whether a programmer prefers smart
    pointers or accessors, this paper shows the limitations and recommends an
    implementation."

    using precompilation techniques to augment a C++ source program with code
    to allow mostly type-accurate garbage collection.  There are two key
    precompiler transformations.  The first is automatic generation of smart
    pointer classes.  The precompiler defines the smart pointer classes and the
    user utilizes them instead of raw pointers.  These smart pointers supply
    functionality that allows the collector to locate the root set for
    collection.  The second transformation augments the C++ program with code
    that allows the garbage collector to locate internal pointers within
    objects.  This paper describes the precompiler and the garbage collector.
