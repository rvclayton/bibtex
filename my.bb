    describes how a program is put together by means of a hierarchically
    structured collection of pictures, called formal dependency diagrams
    (FDDs).  Icons in an FDD denote a wide range of data and control
    dependencies among the relatively coarse-grained entities contained in
    large programs.  Dependencies considered atomic with respect to one level
    in a hierarchy can be decomposed into a number of dependencies at a lower
    level.  Each dependency can be a predefined primitive of the FDD language
    or it can be defined by a PegaSys user in terms of the primitives.  A
    PegsSys user is given the illusion that logical formulas do not exist, even
    though PegaSys reasons about them internally.  This involves (1) checking
    whether an FDD is meaningful syntactically, (2) determining whether
    hierarchical refinements of an FDD are methodologically sound, and (3)
    deciding whether an FDD hierarchy is logically consistent with the program
    that it is intended to describe.  The techniques used to provide these
    capabilities are discussed along with the logical properties that enable
    PegaSys to maintain the user illusion.",

    the redundancy that can be eliminated by supercompilation may be various,

    profile information in adaptive systems such as just-in-time compilers,
    dynamic optimizers and, binary translators.  In this paper, we show that
    sophisticated software profiling schemes that provide highly accurate
    information in an offline setting are ill-suited for these dynamic code
    generation systems.  We experimentally demonstrate that hot path
    predictions must be made early in order to control the rising cost of
    missed opportunity that result from the prediction delay.  We also show
    that existing sophisticated path profiling schemes, if used in an online
    setting, offer no prediction advantages over simpler schemes that exhibit
    much lower runtime overheads.Based on these observation we developed a new
    low-overhead software profiling scheme for hot path prediction.  Using an
    abstract metric we compare our scheme to path profile based prediction and
    show that our scheme achieves comparable prediction quality.  In our second
    set of experiments we include runtime overhead and evaluate the performance
    of our scheme in a realistic application: Dynamo, a dynamic optimization
    system.  The results show that our prediction scheme clearly outperforms
    path profile based prediction and thus confirm that less profiling as
    exhibited in our scheme will actually lead to more effective hot path
    prediction.",

    Thus, Scheme programmers can formulate layers of abstraction whose
    expressive power greatly surpasses that of ordinary modules.
    Unfortunately, Scheme's macros are also too powerful.  The problem is that
    macro definitions extend the parser, a component of a language's
    environment that is always supposed to terminate and produce predictable
    results, and that they can thus turn the parser into a chaotic and
    unpredictable tool.  In this paper, we report on an experiment to tame the
    power of macros.  Specifically, we introduce a system for specifying and
    restricting the class of shapes that a macro can transform.  We dub the
