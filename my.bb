  abstract     = "This paper considers two fundamental factors entering into
    the maximum speed of transmission of intelligence by telegraph.  These
    factors are signal shaping and choice of codes.  The first is concerned
    with the best wave shape to be impressed on the transmitting medium so as
    to permit of greater speed without undue interference either in the circuit
    under consideration or in those adjacent, while the latter deals with the
    choice of codes which will permit of transmitting a maxi-mum amount of
    intelligence with a given number of signal elements.  It is shown that the
    wave shape depends somewhat on the type of circuit over which intelligence
    is to be transmitted and that for most cases the optimum wave is neither
    rectangular nor a half cycle sine wave as is frequently used but a wave of
    special form produced by sending a simple rectangular wave through a
    suitable network.  The impedances usually associated with telegraph
    circuits are such as to produce a fair degree of signal shaping when a
    rectangular voltage wave is impressed.  Consideration of the choice of
    codes show that while it is desirable to use those involving more than two
    current values, there are limitations which prevent a large number of
    current values being used.  A table of comparisons shows the relative speed
    efficiencies of various codes proposed.  It is shown that no advantages
    result from the use of a sine wave for telegraph transmission as proposed
    by Squier and others and that their arguments are based on erroneous
    assumptions.",
